If you *actually* cared about the people of Gaza, and not just maintaining your unimpeachable morals, then you\u2019d be voting *against* the catastrophe that would be Trump for the Palestinian people of Gaza. \n\nTrump has repeatedly admired Netanyahu, told him he\u2019s not going far enough, and joked Gaza would make good beachfront property for Israel. Trump likes Netanyahu and desires his admiration. There\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to stand up to him or push for peace, let alone broker it. \n\nSo to all those planning to vote third party or abstain because they can\u2019t stomach Harris\u2019s stance on Israel: what\u2019s your plan come Nov. 6? One of them WILL win, and if people don\u2019t vote for Harris, it\u2019ll be Trump. \n\nWant to take a stand today? Vote for the best chance for peace, the best chance for the U.S. to stand up to Netanyahu. \n\nI am genuinely SO perplexed by the shortsightedness of these people. All so they can have their conscience clear because they \u201cdidn\u2019t vote for Kamala\u201d?? Well you sure af aren\u2019t helping the issue. Y\u2019all are being selfish. ",

They talked to family and friends of one soldier in particular.\n\nThey interrogated his colleague. It turned out the deceased was tasked with driving a bulldozer. His colleague is quoted saying that they were forced to run over people, dead and alive, in the hundreds.\n\nThe good thing is that the article begins with a warning that there might be disturbing details for readers. What's shocking though is that it is not about the horror of the trucks squashing people, no, rather about the story of the suicide of the soldiers.\n\nTo be fair, the colleague called them terrorists, not people. So it's fair game I guess.\n\nHere is the source\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/21/middleeast/gaza-war-israeli-soldiers-ptsd-suicide-intl/index.html",

I've heard the moral high ground argument, but being morally right while still being practical about reality can also be done. \n\nExpressed Deltas where I think I agree. Also partially agree if they are feigning it to put pressure but eventually still vote. Sadly can't find the comment. End edit. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI'm not going to put my own politics into this post and just try to explain why I think so.\n\nThere is the tired point that everyone brings up of a democrat non-vote or third-party vote is a vote for Trump because it's a 2 party system, but Progressives say that politicians should be someone who represent our interests and if they don't, we just don't vote for the candidate, which is not a bad point in a vacuum. \n\nFor the anti-electoralists that I've seen, both Kamala and Trump are the same in terms of foreign policy and hence they don't want to vote in any of them. \n\nWhat I think is that Kamala bringing in Walz was a big nod to the progressive side that their admin is willing to go for progressive domestic policies at the least, and the messaging getting more moderate towards the end of the cycle is just to appeal to fringe swing voters and is not an indication of the overall direction the admin will go. \n\nRegardless, every left anti-electoralist also sees Trump as being worse for domestic policy from a progressive standpoint and a 'threat to democracy'. \n\nNow,\n\n 1) I get that they think foreign policy wise they think both are the same, but realistically, one of the two wins, and pushing for both progressive domestic AND foreign policy is going to be easier with Kamala-Walz (emphasis more on Walz) in office than with Trump-Vance in office\n\n2) There are 2 supreme court seats possibly up for grabs in the next 4 years which is incredibly important as well, so it matters who is in office\n\n3) In case Kamala wins even if they don't vote, Because the non and third party progressive voters are so vocal about their distaste for Kamala and not voting for her, she'll see less reason to cater to and implement Progressive policies\n\n4) In case Kamala wins and they vocally vote Kamala, while still expressing the problems with Gaza, the Kamala admin will at the least see that progressive voters helped her win and there can be a stronger push with protests and grassroots movements in the next 4 years\n\n5) In case Trump wins, he will most likely not listen to any progressive policy push in the next 4 years. \n\nIt's clear that out of the three outcomes 3,4,5 that 4 would be the most likely to be helpful to the progressive policy cause\n\nHence, I don't understand the left democrat voter base that thinks not voting or voting third party is the way to go here, especially since voting federally doesn't take much effort and down ballot voting and grassroots movements are more effective regardless. \n\nI want to hear why people still insist on not voting Kamala, especially in swing states, because the reasons I've heard so far don't seem very convincing to me. I'm happy to change my mind though. ",

I think there are are many ways I could tackle this but by far the strongest arguments against this claim is just in a review of the numbers.   \n\n\nHamas states the current death toll as around 11000 about 0.55% of the total population.   \nThe population of Gaza being 2 million.  \nAlso, Gaza is about as densely populated as Hong Kong.  \nTherefore currently 99.45% of Gazans remain alive.\n\nIsrael has the military capability to nuke Gaza, but not only that they have enough conventional ordinance to do as much damage as nuke on Gaza would do. \n\nGaza city specifically has a population of 590,481and is likely the most densely populated part of Gaza.\n\nIf Israel wanted to they could destroy that city entirely within a night and literally kill virtually the entire population. \n\nThey haven't - therefore the only logical conclusion is that they are not attempting to kill as many civilians as they can and therefore are not committing a genocide.   \n\n\n  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n   \n",

PALESTINE. \n\n2.) i know that it is U.S. tax payer money going to israel. again, I KNOW THAT IT IS OUR TAX MONEY GOING TO ISRAEL. (because according to some people on reddit, that's the only reason they care about what's happening in palestine in the first place, so fuck everyone else, huh?) \n\nnow that those are out of the way, i just really have to say that i am sick and fucking tired of these holier-than-thou \"turbo leftists\" who talk about israel/palestine but NEVER speak up about the other horrible shit happening in the world, including but not limited to:\n\n- GENOCIDE of uyghur muslims in china\n\n\n- GENOCIDE in darfur \n\n\n- sudan famine \n\n\n- girls in afghanistan cannot attend school past 6th grade\n\n\n- women in afghanistan, as of wednesday, cannot show their faces to men they are not related to by blood or marriage, they cannot be heard reading aloud or singing as their voices are deemed \"intimate\", they are not allowed to talk to non-muslim women, and they cannot travel alone.\n\n\n- slavery in saudi arabia\n \n\n- famine and displacement in the DRC (democratic republic of the congo) on top of a deadly oubtreak of mpox \n\n\n- war crimes in myanmar including systematic torture, gang r*pe, and abuse against CHILDREN\n\n\nand yes, OF COURSE, people can care about more than one issue at once. yeah, that sentiment is all well and good until i consider the fact that i have not seen anyone talking about any of the things i listed above. not a single one of these finger-pointing, morally superior, definitely-not-virtue-signalling lefties have spoken a single fucking PEEP about sudan or myanmar or afghanistan, etc. etc. \n\nit genuinely makes me sick and leads me to believe yall don't actually even care about palestine, you just want fucking internet brownie points. i am TIRED of seeing people who want what's best for OUR COUNTRY being told that they support genocide bc they are terrified of another donald trump presidency. \n\nspeaking of which, if trump wins this year he will be 10x WORSE for palestine. it blows my mind that some people think we DESERVE another trump term. (like seriously, fuck you and your family if you feel that way) tell that to your trans friends. tell that to those needing abortions. tell that to the millions of people that could be deported to a country THEY'VE NEVER EVEN LIVED IN. tell the palestinian people that you allowed donald trump back into office bc you decided voting with your conscience was more important than doing the right thing. \n",

            "body": "According to recent reports by the US, Hezbollah has a stockpile of some 120k-200k rockets and missiles as well as an unknown number of drones that it will use in an all-out war with Israel. This arsenal would allow Hezbollah to fire approximately 3,000 rockets a day for three weeks straight which could potentially overwhelm the Iron Dome.\n\nWhile this is likely welcome news in the eyes of many pro-Palestinians who would love to see Israel face \"retribution\" for its actions in Gaza, it is unlikely that they fully comprehend the consequences of such a scenario.\n\nWhile the Iron Dome has obviously protected the lives of Israelis, it is rarely mentioned if at all that it also protects the lives of Palestinians when it intercepts rockets fired by Hamas and the PIJ. The Iron Dome gives Israel the ability to sustain numerous attacks without requiring a severe response in order to prevent damage to its infrastructure or death of its civilians.\n\nHowever, if the Iron Dome was ever to be overwhelmed resulting in Israelis dying en masse and critical infrastructure being destroyed the gloves would immediately come off.\n\nThis is where the concept of proportionality comes in. Under International Humanitarian Law:\n\n>Launching an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated, is prohibited.\n\nAssuming the current 97% success rate of the Iron Dome and 3,000 rockets a day for three weeks, Israel would be hit 1,890 times over that period. If Israel runs out of interceptor missiles or if Iron Dome batteries are hit, that number will skyrocket.\n\nDue to the increased risk of damage and death from rocket and drone attacks, Israel would calculate proportionality much differently than it has done until now as the military advantage anticipated from taking out military targets would be significantly greater than the potential collateral damage caused by destroying Hezbollah's military infrastructure and personnel.\n\nIn other words, the IDF will adopt a scorched earth policy in Lebanon to prevent successful attacks on Israel making attacks on Gaza look pale in comparison.\n\nAs such, I think it is in everyone's best interest that the Iron Dome (and other defense systems) succeed at protecting Israel as much as pro-Palestinians may wish to revel at the alternative.",

            "body": "In the Gaza War, the IDF recently rescued four hostages. The operation was brutal, with Hamas fighters fighting to the death to prevent the hostages from being rescued, and civilians caught in the crossfire. Hundreds of civilians died and Israel was able to rescue four hostages. Assuming the 275 civilian death number is accurate, you get an average of 68.75 Palestinian civilians killed for every Israeli hostage recovered. \n\nThis strongly debunks the myth of the so called \u201ctargeted operation war\u201d that many on Reddit call for. Proponents say Israel should not bomb buildings that may contain or conceal terrorist infrastructure, instead launching targeted ground operations to kill Hamas terrorists and recover hostages. This latest raid shows why that just isn\u2019t practical. Assuming the civilian death to hostage recovered ratio remains similar to this operation, over 17,000 Palestinian civilians would be killed in recovering hostages, let alone killing every Hamas fighter. \n\nHamas is unabashed in their willingness to hide behind their civilians. No matter what strategy Israel uses in this war, civilians will continue to die. This operation is yet more evidence that the civilian deaths are the fault of Hamas, not Israel, and that a practical alternative strategy that does not involve civilian deaths is impractical. ",

I have been to various VAs over the past year, pre Biden dropout, noticed many a boomer dawning the red hat. \n\nLast week was my first VA trip since the rise of Harris and post Trump Arlington photo shoot. In my week there saw one red hat and dude ended up detained. Trump hat wearing dude lost his shit when the other vets were telling him Trump didn\u2019t support vets, the vets were at first questioning why he thought it was smart wearing that hat after Trumps recent events/statements about vets, in a non threatening manner. \n\nTrumper immediately ended up going in on racist tirade about \u201c(n-word) Hatians eating cats\u201d, then started threatening violence when the group of guys started laughing at him about it. Trumper was unhinged. A group of 5 vets ended up securing him by standing right on him and making sure he couldn\u2019t pull a weapon until the cops came out, they were on him immediately after threatening to kill them. Trumper was frisked, cops removing a pocket knife, and ended up walking him inside into a room, though didn\u2019t cuff him.\n\nUnsure if the Trumpster was arrested, but not smart to threaten violence.  The guys asking the questions were asked by VA police to not engage others with one of them telling the cops when he sees bullshit hats he\u2019s gonna call \u201cthese unpatriotic shits out.\u201d. Cops said nothing more and walked off.\n\nI was not surprised to see this, but was shocked to see only one red hat in my week there as previously to last week saw a ton of those hats. I was in red state south, btw. ",

Obviously, I know it's fake, but it just reminds me of how quickly life can be snuffed out, and it's even worse when it's the hero of the movie callously blowing people's brains out and continuing on as if nothing happened.

Frankly, the people responsible for war crimes on either side need to be held accountable under international law. There\u2019s no excuse for allowing this violence to continue unchecked.\n\nNow, about this idea of a one-state solution seriously? It\u2019s hard to picture two groups who\u2019ve been at each other\u2019s throats for decades suddenly living together in one happy state. The level of hatred and mistrust between Israelis and Palestinians isn\u2019t something that just disappears because someone draws new borders. Trying to force them into a single state feels like a recipe for disaster.\n\nThe demographics alone would be a nightmare. Depending on the immigration, one group is bound to end up with more power than the other. Whether it\u2019s Jews or Arabs, one side will inevitably dominate politically, economically, and socially, which is just going to fuel even more resentment. And honestly, the last thing this conflict needs is more reasons for people to feel oppressed or sidelined.\n\nIn the end, a one-state solution seems like one of the worst ideas out there. The violence wouldn\u2019t magically go away. In fact, it would probably get worse. Both sides have lost too much, and there\u2019s way too much bad blood to think that merging them into a single state would work. Any real solution has to acknowledge their differences and deal with the core issues, not just mash them together and hope for the best",

Let's set aside emotions and wishes, and focus on reality and facts. Are you in favor of a one-state solution or a two-state solution?\n\nThis conflict has been ongoing for decades, with each side entrenched in its own position. The one-state option is accepted by one side but rejected by the other. Palestinians see it as their state alone, while Israel sees it as the establishment of its own state without recognizing Palestinian sovereignty. So far, no progress has been made because each side is adamant about its stance.\n\nOn the other hand, the two-state solution is disputed in terms of its borders and conditions.\n\nFrom another perspective: The one-state solution is popular among the people but officially rejected, while the two-state solution is officially accepted but unpopular among the people.\n\nDo you think the two-state solution could be a path to resolving the crisis and occupation? Do you see it as a viable option?\n\nThere are countries that have occupied others and later became accepted internationally. Could this be a possible solution, considering its success in some cases? \n\nIs America an example? It once occupied land but now is a recognized state. Does this mean that resolution is just a matter of time? If so, why not expedite the process now?\n\nJust because we oppose Sykes-Picot and curse it, does it mean Palestine is its result? Why defend borders set by an adversary?\n\nI have many more thoughts and questions, but for now, what do you think?",

It is a Palestinian autonomous region under Israeli sovereignty, and its width is between 3km and 6km. The Palestinians there will receive Israeli citizenship.\n\nThe dark blue area is a 300m to 600m wide military zone that separates the Gaza Strip from Egypt. Israel controls the entire Egyptian border.\n\nThere are also some other land swaps. The Gaza Strip gets some extra area. The West Bank gets more area in the north and south, making it a bit longer, but the westernmost areas to Tel Aviv, including the settlement Ariel, are transferred to Israel. This makes Israel a bit wider in the center. There would also minor adjustments to the borders, so Israel gets the larger settlements that are not deep in the West Bank, such as Givat Ze'ev, and Beitar Illit, although this doesn't show in my map.\n\nThe reason for these land swaps are for Israel's security. Israel controlling the Egyptian and Jordanian border is to prevent weapons from reaching the demilitarized Palestinian state. The distance from large cities like Tel Aviv to Palestinian territory is also a bit longer than in the 1967 borders. To compensate, the Palestinian state gets some extra land, that ideally should be as much in area as the West Bank areas that get transferred to Israel.\n\nJerusalem would be under Israeli sovereignty, but there could be some form of autonomy in East Jerusalem for Palestinians.\n\nPalestinian will get the right of return to the Palestinian state, but not to Israel nor the Palestinian autonomous region in sovereign Israel.\n\nThere would be a tunnel connecting the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.\n\nThere would be trade agreements between Israel and Palestine. Palestine would have to be peaceful to Israel, and as long as it doesn't threaten Israel, Israel would have to allow Palestine to engage in trade with other countries. Israel must not block Palestine from trade, unless Palestine behaves aggressively toward it militarily, or by promoting or allowing terrorism.\n\nThis is something I have been thinking about. There are still other questions remaining, such as what will happen to the rest of the Israeli settlements in the Palestinian state, I currently don't have a good answer to that question.\n\nWhat do you think? Is this a good solution?\n\n[A potential two-state solution](https://preview.redd.it/kkz89nuorhjd1.png?width=731&format=png&auto=webp&s=999c24d06458b3c1df13617137e8f01b5b9e64ab)\n\n",

I say that because my understanding is that the foundation of Israel did not intend to displace people per the UN plan and the neighboring country invasions led to much of the pain. It also bothers me that people think Oct 7 was justified. However, I want the violence to stop and I am afraid that Netanyahu's goal to \"eliminate\" Hamas may do more harm than good. I am also concened on abandoning two state which leads to....\n\nWhy abandon the two state idea? Isn't two state fundamental to your state? ie. Jews get a state so Palestinians get a state including West Bank and Gaza Strip. \n\nIf the Gaza strip/West Bank is a state, couldn't they be held more accountable than just a rag tag terrorist group?\n\nDoesn't this just basically make a second class of people (Palestinians) under the thumb of the IDF? They would live under Israel rule, but not have the rights of citizens? Wouldn't' this \"prove\" that Israel was out to to conquer and control land that wasn't theirs?\n\nIf you are controlling them, what do you think the end game is? What conditions would need to be met for the IDF to withdraw in your mind? \n\nI suppose his point is safety of Israel - which is rightly his priority. Wouldn't beefing up the security on your side be easier than say, controlling Gaza? Hamas is nuts, but how did the security fail? Should it have even failed with your current level of security? \n\nWhat is wrong with the Arab led security that Biden has in mind? Especially with a country you have normalized relations with. Would this achieve the goal of 1) no Hamas and 2) not create further tension by controlling them?",

Despite the passing of the UN Resolution 181, it was rejected by Palestinian Arabs and Arab nations. \n\nArab nations (Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Jordan (Transjordan), Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, etc\u2026) started the 1948 Arab-Israel war by invading territory in the former British Mandate for Palestine immediately following the announcement of the independence of the state of Israel on May 14, 1948. \n\nMy questions\n\n1. If the Palestinians and pro-Palestine supporters wanted a two state solution, why did they reject UN resolution 181 and started the 1948 Arab-Israel war ? If only Palestinians and pro-Palestine supporters had accepted UN resolution 181, there would have been no war and a sovereign nation called Palestine would has been long established back in 1948, 76 years ago.\n\n2. At its very core the UN resolution 181 : United Nations Partition Plan for British Mandate for Palestine is very similar to any two state solution, the map or borders may differ with each version, but at the end of the day, UN resolution 181 and two state solution aims to create two sovereign states, one Jewish (Israel) and one Arab (Palestine). Is the UN resolution 181 similar to other proposed two state solution throughout the years ?\n\n3. If the UN resolution 181 is similar (not exactly identical, but similar) to a two state solution which has already been rejected by the Palestinians and pro-Palestine supporters 76 years ago which started a war, and now some Palestinians, some pro-Palestinians, many governments and non-government organizations are yet again calling for a similar two state solution. What has changed since 76 years ago ? Why do Palestinians and pro-Palestine supporters now want a two state solution which they had rejected 76 years ago ? ",

            "body": "The more I read from pro-palestine and free palestine sources, both online and in print and in books, it seems clear that a 2-state solution is not what they have ever wanted.\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe Nakba is the most important event in Palestinian history. Over 700,000 people were displaced during a war resulting from Arab armies invading Israel. The entire objective of the Free Palestine movement is essentially to turn back time to 1948 and get a do-over.\n\nA two-state solution is sadly not a solution Palestinians want or deem acceptable. It's why every single Free Palestine necklace, poster, imagery showcases a map that includes the entire land of Israel. The entire land is Palestine in their eyes.\n\nThe idea of a Palestinian country sitting just on Gaza and the West Bank (with a shared Jerusalem) is insufficient, which is why they are holding strong to the idea of a full right of return for all refugees and their descendants. The demand, however, is impractical and detrimental to their cause as it's a non-starter for Israel.\n\nIt's curious and bizarre that no other refugee group in history, besides the Palestinians, includes descendants of actual refugees. Despite this, Israel in peace offers in the past has offered to take in 100,000 refugees who actually lived in what is now Israel, while also helping establish a $30 BILLION fund to help descendents resettle in a newly formed Palestinian state and elsewhere.\n\nThis offer was rejected.\n\nThe offer wasn't good enough because the real issue is the existence of Israel itself, which Palestinians believe was created on stolen land. Never mind the fact that none of this would have happened had Arab armies not invaded, the fact remains that the Palestinian cause is so rooted in the removal of Israel as a Jewish entity that a two-state solution isn't something Palestinians view as an acceptable solution.\n\nThe Palestinian vision for peace involves the removal of Israel as a country and a new country in its place with a majority Palestinian population. It's why Free Palestine folks are now advocating for a single state solution, which is a nice way of saying that Israel will evaporate to make way for Palestine. It's essentially saying --  Israel has created a thriving democracy for 75 years, lets just piggyback off that and make it our own instead of building our own country.\n\nThe Palestinians feel that they are owed all of the land, and are constantly told that if they continue to insist on this, they will get it. This is why, in the United States, people who have never lived in or around Israel continue to talk about how the state was stolen from them. In contrast, every other group of refugees in history (especially those who suffered as a result of losing a war) have moved on and accepted the reality of their current situation.\n\nI used to believe a two-state solution was possible, but after seeing what the vast majority of Pro-Palestine publications and pundits are putting forth, it seems that the idea of Israel in its current form -- without the return of millions of Palestinans -- is a dealbreaker. Which is tragic because if true, the Palestinians would rather cling to the notion of the right of return in perpetutity rather than start country-building.\n\nThere will never be peace until a Palestinian leader emerges who can blankly state that Israel is a reality and that a 2-state solution is the only path towards peace.",

Realistically, moving back over 5 million palestinian refugees would not be possible given the size of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. There simply wouldn't be enough land available for 5 million more people, I mean Israel's entire population at the time was 7 million.\n\nThere were attempts to overcome this such as proposals to allow refugees the right to return in Israel proper but the palestinians requested 150,000 every year. Israel is right to be concerned that demographically this would lead to the state changing from a jewish state to a multinational state.\n\nI acknowledge the counter arguments regarding justice but a right of return would mean the end of Israel and palestinians know this. It's not worth giving up on peace because of this. I mean look at the current crisis which could have been wholly avoided especially in Gaza.\n\nI know that the incompetent and corrupt PA leaders were also one of the main reasons talks failed.",

You can Google and the clip I\u2019m about to talk about comes up right away. In the episode, gnomes are stealing underwear from the residents of South Park and plan to make a profit. The boys visit their cave and the ask the gnomes how they plan to make a profit with the underwear. The gnomes show them a chalk board with three phases: 1. Steal underwear. 2. ? 3. Make a profit. No matter how many times the boys tried to nail down phase 2, the gnomes could not explain how to get from phase 1 to phase 3. My brain connected this to what Ezra was saying. We, in the west, can\u2019t seem to articulate phase 2 for a two state solution. \n\nThoughts? I\u2019m new to this sub, so sorry if this is too ridiculous. I just can\u2019t get it out of my head.

However, I don\u2019t see any other realistic solution which would have a chance of achieving peace and stability. Obviously any sort of negotiations could only begin after the conflict in Gaza is over and the hostages are released. \n\nThe only realistic alternative to a two state solution in my opinion is one state with equal rights for Jews and Palestinians. But neither side would be happy with this arrangement. Palestinians would never accept Israeli citizenship if it was offered to them nor would they want it. Jordan and most other countries in the region would not want a new wave of Palestinian refugees or immigrants entering their country. This solution would leave millions of Palestinians living in Israel without the same rights as Jews or Arab Israelis. It would also cause a significant amount of outrage in the international community, and possibly even trade sanctions against Israel, and make Jews the minority. \n\nAre there other solutions to the conflict that I may not be aware of? I don\u2019t think an indefinite military occupation of the West Bank is realistic even if for now it is necessary due to security concerns.

            "body": "Hey everyone, \n\nWith this being the final week before the election and with so much talk about youth crime I thought it would be a good time to make a post about the matter. \n\nI work in youth detention and more specifically my role is to lower the recidivism rate among young offenders. Everything I say here is backed up by the experts in the field. \n\n **TLDR** at the bottom. \n\n\n\nBelow I will discuss my role, the types of kids we get, the motivations behind youth crime, the solutions to this problem, and how you can keep yourself safe. \n\n\n\n**My role & background**\n\nAs stated, I work in youth detention, across 2 of the 3 youth detention facilities in the state. My role is to help the young people in detention to create a sense of identity that is not based around crime/being a youth criminal and instead help them find productive ways to address the issues in their lives that are leading them to crime. It involves a lot of unpacking trauma and helping them form healthy and productive self identities. \n\nI got into this sector after a violent home invasion. I\u2019ll spare you the details. \nAt the time I was teaching at a primary school in Woodridge (Logan) and the young person who broke in looked very similar to the kind of kids I would teach for a term or two before they moved on. The kids who were constantly passed from foster care to residential care or who got shuffled around public housing because their carers were incapable of caring for them. He looked desperate in every sense of the word. Like he hadn\u2019t eaten in several days or slept in just as long. \n\nIt was probably the scariest thing we\u2019ve ever been through.. But this was the reason I switched industries. When I saw this kid I remembered being that hungry kid who didn\u2019t have a consistently safe place to sleep. I remember being desperate and while I never broke into houses I probably looked a lot like this young person did when I was their age. \n\n\n**The Kids & their motivations** \n\nWhen we discuss the kids in detention it is important to discuss their motivations. We generally get 4 types of kids. Although the stats have not ever been counted for QLD, they did studies in WA and Nationals and found that 90+% of youth criminals had experienced FDV and 75-80% had been victims of sexual violence. Both those numbers jump up above 95% for the females in youth detention. These kids have complex trauma and they simply aren\u2019t getting the help they need. \n\nWhile I\u2019ve changed the names and complied lots of kids into the example, most/all the kids I\u2019ve seen in detention fit into 1 of the 4 categories below; \n\n\n**Alex** - Alex makes up 20% of the kids we get in detention. They are a kid who gets caught up with the wrong people and makes a stupid choice one night while under the influence. They are a kid who generally has a place to sleep and food to eat, but often tries to avoid being home because their family life is unpleasant. Likely a victim of domestic violence, with poor school outcomes because of it. While hanging around with the wrong people to avoid being at home they get caught up with a group of kids who are doing crimes for clout. They ride around in a stolen car or maybe steal one themselves because they are searching for acceptance or belonging. Alex generally wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone unless cornered or threatened, and we do not see Alex consistently, often times only once. \u201cAlex\u201d makes up about 75% of the females we get in detention. Alex often only comes in once or twice as a youth and usually never as an adult. \n\n\n**Lou** - Lou makes up about 60% of the kids in detention. They do not have a consistently safe place to live outside detention. They do crimes for money primarily because they don\u2019t have access to food or shelter. Often parents are in detention or unsafe to be around due to FDV or Sexual Violence. Often homeless and pushed out of their rentals by rising rents and cost of living. Lou was often exposed to drugs at home at a young age and uses drugs to help ease their pain & deal with their trauma. Lou often asks to remain in detention after their sentence because it is a safe space with shelter, food, and adults who care for them. The stuff most normal kids take for granted. Lou consistently comes back into detention directly after being released. Lou is desperate and will fight to survive. Most regular Aussies can\u2019t fathom this because it is so far from their lived experience. Lou is in & out consistently through their teenage years but often only once or twice as an adult. \n\n\n**Talon** - makes up about 15% of the youth in detention but a much larger portion of the youth crimes in regional areas. They are often people who struggle to integrate into Australian society either because they are an immigrant kid who doesn\u2019t fit in with Australia\u2019s largely white/casually racist society so they look for belonging in gangs. Alternatively they are indigenous kids who are suffering from massive intergenerational trauma. Surviving the scars of colonialism and the stolen generations. They are victims of abuse at home and in public, they fall through the cracks of white society schooling, and they turn to crime because why not. These kids often go to Townsville where I do not work so I can\u2019t speak to it in as much depth but we often get transfers down in Brisbane when Townsville is full. \n\n\n**Sam** - Sam makes up 5% of the kids in detention. They have severe mental health issues and enjoy hurting people both physically and/or psychologically. They are almost always survivors of extreme trauma stemming from Sexual Violence and Domestic Violence and self medicate (because mental health care is inaccessible in QLD) with extreme substances. They will absolutely kill you for your car keys because they have nothing to lose. Sam is in detention long term both as a youth and adult. \n\n\n\n**Solutions to lower youth crime**\n\nWe are never going to solve this problem. Any society built on capitalism is inherently unfair and inequitable, and any time you have inequality you will have crime. \n\nFirst solution is to lower inequality. When everyone has shelter and enough food this issue starts to solve itself. \n\nSecondly, we need to take FDV and SV seriously. Perpetrators need to be removed from society and victims need to be taken seriously and be provided support. \n\nThirdly, we need to add mental health support to all who need it bulk billed. I see one of the more affordable psychologists around and it still costs me $200 for an hour. That is simply inaccessible to most. You can\u2019t solve complex/intergenerational trauma without help. \n\nFinally, we need more small regional detention centres. This is what the government has been trying to do but has been held up by NIMBY\u2019s and councils. Currently if a kid gets arrested in Bundy they are sent to Brisbane for detention. That makes it very difficult to maintain community connections and to get that kid set up for success once they are out. All that equals a kid who is going to offend again because they don\u2019t have many other options. West Moreton youth detention centre is a good example of this. They are a small centre of only 24 (I believe) beds and service Ipswich/the western corridor exclusively. This allows them to create community connections and link with services so that kids are set up for success when they are released. It\u2019s just not realistic for a kid from Weipa to be set up for success after being released from detention in Townsville or Brisbane.  \n\n\n**How to keep yourself safe** \n\nRight if you don\u2019t want to be the victim of youth crime there are some easy preventative measures you can take. \n\nMake your home a hard target. Crimsafe/security screens. Always keep the door locked unless you are passing through it. Be aware of your soundings. \n\nUnless it is worth getting stabbed over, don\u2019t fight for it. Just let it go then call the police and insurance. I promise no matter how tough you are, knives are tougher. Every break in that has turned violent or deadly has been because some person who thinks they are super tough tried to stop some kid from stealing their car and ended up getting stabbed for the keys. If you wouldn\u2019t die for it, just let it go. Things can be replaced. \n\n\n\n**TLDR** most youth criminals are extremely desperate people who are housing and food insecure. They are almost always suffering from extreme trauma from FDV and SV and often have fallen through the cracks at school because they moved around a lot. Very few enjoy doing crime and would much rather be a rich kid at a private school if given the chance. To most people, understanding that these kids have been through things that are unimaginable to you and having empathy towards that is difficult. \n\nWe need more small regional detention centres, most public housing, more food security and more bulk billed mental health support. None of the things the LNP are suggesting. ",

It puts those of us who have supported Israel in an impossible position when we lean into the 1967 borders as the solution, because every other solution proves the cynics right. There is no moral argument we can make to those who support Palestinians if there isn\u2019t a promise of Palestinian statehood somewhere along the way. Bibi is proving every cynic right - he\u2019s feeding the worst of his foes causes and he\u2019s alienating Israel\u2019s supporters.\n\nI will always stand by the Jewish people - but the state of Israel will lose the support it needs to survive if it Bibi gets his way. Not overnight - but he aware: Demographics are changing, young people in Israel\u2019s closest allied states don\u2019t support Israel the same way as older voters - some openly oppose it. Those are our future voters, and old people die every day... (In fact, the idea of Palestinians moving to the west as Bibi once suggested - Canada specifically - is a great way to move our politics against Israel as those people become voters and will be incredibly proactive in anti Israeli propaganda when they get here)\n\nSome people need a reason to believe Israel credibly and believably cares about a peaceful future where Palestinians aren\u2019t an \u201coccupied people\u201d, or they will dig in and we will have nothing to dig them out with.\n\nIf status quo continues (or degrades), then in a generation or so, foreign policy will change completely to align with the new demographic realities. Diplomacy will change, the surety of American support could in fact turn into surety of American sanctions, repealing of laws of unyielding support or modification to ensure reduced support\u2026 the polls show many young western voters would support that course or action Today.\n\nA two state solution gives Israel a far better chance to go on a charm offensive over the next generation, and give those of us who support Israel, what we need to convince people that Israel is the honest actor - a true democracy - a liberalized society - a civilization that belongs and is part of Our civilizational family and belongs with us. Deserves our respect, and when needed, our cover of protection.\n\nReading what Bibi was saying sucked the wind out of my sails and ripped them down for a bit\u2026 I will continue to fight the hate, support my Jewish brothers and sisters, stand with Israel\u2026 but if Israel abandons the two state solution completely, I will become more silent, been proven wrong by every single person I argued with when they told me \u201cit wouldn\u2019t work because Israel would never let it work\u201d. I know the Palestinians rejected peace 7 times, they may reject it 7 more. They will fight again, possibly. My hope is not\u2026 \n\nBut We don\u2019t stop fighting for peaceful coexistence. Because the other option is Bellum ad infinitum - endless war - and it will burn the region and part of the world down with it\u2026 and No One but the monsters who don\u2019t value human life want that\u2026\n\nSince the tragedy of Oct 7, it had been day after day of tragedy after tragedy. Thousands dead. Thousands more suffering. All this blood is on Hamas hands \u2026 but if a real effort for peace doesn\u2019t start, there will be no end. Israel will never be safe, and in a generation or two, it could find itself alone in the world\u2026 and That, my friends, is my worst fear from what Bibi has said.",

While many Palestinians wholeheartedly oppose a two state solution, some do support it, and one of its two main political factions officially endorses it.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve come to realize that what Israel/the international community and I mean by a two state solution is different than what is meant by Palestinian leadership. \n\nFor Israelis, and for Western diplomats, a two state solution means two states for two peoples. That is a Jewish state, with a Jewish majority and national character as well as an Arab minority in Israel, and an Arab majority state in Palestine with an Arab Palestinian national character. (I personally think that that Arab majority state should have a Jewish minority just as Israel has an Arab minority, but many Israelis and Western players don\u2019t view that as feasible given the nature of Palestinian nationalism). \n\nHowever, Fatah insists that a 2 state solution by paired with a full and inalienable right of return for 6 million registered Palestinian refugees as well as dismantling of all settlements. Presumably there would be no right of return for the Jews who were forcibly evicted by Arab forces in 1948/9 from the West Bank or their descendants. \n\nThat would make Israel a binational state, or even perhaps an Arab majority state, along made an Arab-exclusive, Jew-free state in the West Bank and Gaza. So their vision is at best a binational state within the Green Line alongside a Palestinian Arab state in the West Bank and Gaza, or 2 Palestinian Arab states side by side. This may be a final vision, but more likely just a stepping stone towards integration of these two states.\n\nSo pro-2SS pro-Fatah Palestinians and their activists: does your vision of 2 states include 2 states for 2 peoples, creating political homelands for both Jews and Palestinians respectively? Does your vision include the idea of homelands for 2 respective peoples? Do you view Jews as a people deserving of self determination equal, not superior or inferior to that of Palestinians. If so, is that compatible with the right of return? If not, why not? And if not, do you think Palestinian leaders of Fatah has been misleading the world in making it seem they support a two states for two peoples framework.?\n\n(I am not asking for the opinions of 1 state solution activists, either supporters of a single Palestinian state or a binational state. I am specifically asking for 2SS supporters. I respectfully ask that non-2SS supporters save their thoughts for a different thread).\n",

Find somewhere for everyone to live in integrated multicultural nation like Israel is always claiming to already be.\n\nThere will never be a two state solution. Israel began with an inequitable to Arabs partition proposal and went downhill from there. Two states was always a pipe dream and a stall tactic. \n\nIMHO it was unethical in any form anyway. European sins should have been atoned for with European real estate for a \u201chomeland.\u201d Germans are the one who tried to genocide them. The whole 20th century was a move toward decolonization except for England giving away Palestine to European and Asian Jews to begin colonizing *like people didn\u2019t already fucking live there* The Nakba was a crime.\n\nLast random thoughts, why do Jews uniquely deserve a \u201chomeland\u201d? Plenty of groups don\u2019t have one and no one ever even suggests they should have one. Why do Jews of the world need Israel \u201cto be safe\u201d? Are they not safe in America?

Why not stop making future terrorists and turning world opinion more against Israel? Why not one state? I bet non right wing Israelis would have already done it if they were ever in charge.\n\nIn 2023 every cell phone has a video camera and the internet. We see this war in real time. We see settlers in real time. We see your liberal citizens protesting the authoritarian slide of their government. We see many Jews all over the world rebuking what\u2019s happening in Israel.

Image here: [https://imgur.com/a/DiW8uz8](https://imgur.com/a/DiW8uz8)\n\nHi Everyone. I'm very disheartened to share this news as a longtime and loyal Intel customer. I've purchased roughly $20,000 worth of merchandise with them over my lifetime and I've never once had to open any RMA requests until now. Unfortunately, it's very clear they are not standing behind their products and I'm going to provide to ton of detail and pictures below on what happened involving TWO retail boxed 14900Ks, one purchased from Amazon on 10/16/2023 (this was the release date of the 14900K for anyone not in the know) which was shipped from and sold by\u00a0[Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/), and one from Microcenter (brand new, not open box or anything like that, grabbed right off the shelf) on 02/11/2024, both experiencing the wide-spread instability issues.\n\nIntel has claimed that both products are \"re-marked\" and not genuine. The problem is that they definitely are not re-marked. They also tried to claim that one of them was a tray processor and thereby not subject to retail warranty, which they backtracked on, and then went the route of claiming it was re-marked.\n\nFull disclosure: Intel provided me with letters stating that the CPUs are not genuine and asked me to return them to their respective stores for a solution. I've done this and both stores, despite being WAY outside of return windows, DID refund me. Amazon gave me a full refund to my original payment method, and Microcenter gave me a full refund in store credit. In the end this worked out better for me, but that's beside the point. Now these two companies are having to shoulder the cost and burden of Intel's failure to take responsibility, and that's not right.\n\nThat being said, I'll be providing uncensored pictures of the retail boxes and CPUs which will show the full batch numbers and the full serial numbers. Since these CPUs are not in my possession anymore, and are ultimately going back to Intel, I feel it's fine to share them in their totality.\n\nHere's the details:\n\nThe processor purchased from Microcenter on 02/11/2024, partial serial 02096:\n\nI filled out the RMA form. Intel got back to me the next day admitting that the CPU was faulty. They then asked me for my shipping details and proof of purchase. I provided it. They then asked for pictures of the IHS. I provided it. Another day passes and they get back to me stating that the CPU is not genuine and is re-marked. WHAT!? This is news to me. This was purchased from a reputable retailer directly off the shelf. It was not open box, the seal was completely intact, and there was absolutely nothing suspicious about it. Furthermore, it showed correctly in CPU-Z as a 14900K and frequencies checked out, boosting to 6GHz single core and 5.7GHz all-core. I conveyed all of this information to Intel, and provided additional pictures of the IHS and the serial number just in case the previous pictures were too blurry. I also provided a picture of the retail box, clearly showing the full serial number and batch number, which did match the CPU. I also plugged in the batch number and serial number into Intel's warranty checker tool and it came back as valid with warranty until 2027. I took a screenshot of that and provided it as well. You can see all of those images in the image link below. They got back to me and said that their response hasn't changed and that they cannot divulge their investigation process. They insisted I return it to Microcenter with a letter they provided that it was not genuine. I did so, and Microcenter took a look. They said there was absolutely no evidence of tampering. The only thing they thought it might be was that there was some thermal paste still on the side of the CPU, and they said it made it look like it could have been delidded (however they confirmed it was NOT delidded). They suggested reporting their findings to Intel, and wiping away the paste and taking new pictures. I then reported those finding to Intel, to which they repeated that they cannot divulge the investigation process and they said that new pictures would not change their findings. It was at this point they told me I could continue with getting an RMA, but that if the chip was found to be re-marked they\u00a0**WILL**\u00a0retain and confiscate it. The exact verbiage was, \"We do not disclose our investigation practices. If you believe your products are valid and wish to proceed with a return merchandise authorization (RMA), we can create one.\u00a0**However, if the products fail the validation process, the units will be retained and confiscated, and no replacements or refunds will be provided.**\u00a0For this reason, we are giving you the option to take the letter and share it with the place of purchase. This will give you more possibilities to get a replacement since you have the processors in your possession.\" So, as you can see, they insisted I return it to Microcenter, so I did, and they graciously allowed me to return it for store credit.\n\nHere are all the relevant pictures for 02096, including Intel's letter claiming it is re-marked, original receipt, warranty checker from Intel, retail box, IHS, serial number close-up, a screenshot of the email where they threatened to confiscate the CPU, and a screenshot of their initial response via email:\u00a0[https://imgur.com/a/tC3AFFU](https://imgur.com/a/tC3AFFU)\n\nThe processor purchased from Amazon on 10/16/2023, partial serial 03252:\n\nJust like the last RMA, I filled out the form, they got back to me, said the CPU was indeed confirmed as faulty, asked for my information and pictures, I provided it all. They got back to me and quoted back the WRONG serial number (I provided the correct one in the original form and the picture CLEARLY shows 03252). They quoted that I was talking about 03262. They went on to explain that 03262 is a tray processor and not subject to retail warranty. They suggested that I take it back to the OEM. I got back to them and stated that they were talking about the wrong serial number. I clearly provided 03252. They got back to me and said that the image appeared to be a 6 instead of a 5. At this point I provided closer-up pictures of the serial number and IHS as well as a picture of the retail box showing the matching serial numbers and batch numbers. It was at this point they backtracked and said that 03252 was indeed a retail box. They said I can proceed with the RMA BUT that they were not confident that it would pass fraud validation. He then pointed out, and I quote: \"\n\nWe have reviewed the new photos you provided and will approve the return of the device marked \"03252.\"\n\n* **However,**\u00a0we are not fully convinced that it will pass the incoming fraud inspection at our depot. We strongly recommend that you return the product to your place of purchase.\n* Please familiarize yourself with the Processor Warranty Terms and Conditions, as well as the warning at the bottom of the warranty information page:\u00a0[Intel\u00a0Warranty Info](https://supporttickets.intel.com/s/warrantyinfo?language=en_US). Specifically, \"**Please be advised as part of Intel's ongoing efforts to prevent fraud in the marketplace, in the event the product you submit for warranty support is found to be re-marked or otherwise fraudulent product, Intel reserves the rights to retain the product and/or destroy such product as appropriate**.\"\n\n\"\n\nAt least this time they said they reserve the right to retain or destroy it instead of saying they WILL. At this point I contacted Amazon to let them know what was going on. I can't stress how good Amazon is. They didn't even ask for any extra details or screenshots, they simply allowed me to return the CPU for a full refund to the original payment method despite being 9 months outside of the return window. Kudos to Amazon!\n\nHere are all the relevant images for 03252:\u00a0[https://imgur.com/a/fInP3bC](https://imgur.com/a/fInP3bC)\n\nAt the end of the day, it felt like Intel was grasping at straws. They pounced at the opportunity to claim that one of the CPUs was a tray product, citing a serial number that was never even provided. Then when that didn't pan out, they pivoted to claiming it was re-marked. When I pressed them, giving several pieces of evidence for why each one was indeed valid, they stated I could continue with the RMA process but then turned to threatening me with confiscation or destruction of my property if it didn't meet whatever their validation process (that they won't disclose) is. The odds of both of these being re-marked or not genuine seem extremely low. It's definitely a scare tactic. And even knowing this, it worked on me! This feels like extortion, scamming, you name it.\n\nAnyway, I wanted to get all this out there. Everyone should know what they are doing!",

This would have the benefit of stopping all construction of settlements on Palestinian lands and allow terrorist organizations to be brought up on criminal charges. It would allow the Palestinians to have a sizable vote in the elections, and allow representation in the government. I am sure that there would be blowback from neighboring countries but with citizenship the population of Palestinians would have a voice beyond their small slivers of land. With Palestinians being 20 percent of the population of Israel I am sure it would also make political parties want to get their votes, hence motivating them to make their lives better.\n\nI recognize that this is a very idealist view of the current situation but the idea of a two state solution does not seem to be possible anymore (IMO). I have been a fan of the two state solution for a while, but learned recently that the idea has been around since before Israel even formed. If the idea has never taken root, maybe this could be a viable alternative?\n\nMost of the counterarguments I have heard to the viability of this idea seem to be that obviously current governments would not want this as the separation benefits them. I also am sure that generations of fighting will not suddenly disappear, but with the current war going on could this be a solution after the fighting is done?\n\nI would love to hear people's honest feedback on this unorthodox idea, has it even be proposed before?

Thankfully we don't have kids.\u00a0 I love her and wanted her to be comfortable and I have no problem starting over since I make a good income.\u00a0 But she won't budge or talk about the divorce.\u00a0 \n\nThis brings us to two days ago.\u00a0 I get home and go to our bedroom and find my wife's friend (27f) in our bed naked.\u00a0 I immediately shut the door, said sorry, and went looking for my wife.\u00a0 I found her in the kitchen and asked what her friend was doing here, and she said that she was here for me.\u00a0 I put two and two together and said that I'm not having sex with other women in place of the woman I chose to marry.\u00a0 She was adamant on saying that I could sleep with her whenever I wanted and that her friend agreed to it.\u00a0 I couldn't believe things would get this far so I went back to our bedroom and asked her friend to leave.

Should I just contact my lawyer and try and force the divorce?\u00a0 I'm really uncomfortable with this entire situation. \n\nEdit: We talked last night, I'll update when I get home from work. \n\nEdit 2: \n\nHere's the update if anyone's interested. \n\nI'll try to keep this as concise as possible. I feel overwhelmed so I probably wont bother with another update after this one, I don't know. My wife came to my hotel last night and we talked about everything. She told me the full truth and what's going on in her mind.\n\n\n\n1. A few of you commented this in the last post so you were right. She has always been asexual, she and her whole family has known this since she was 16. Apparently this is the reason why her last long term relationship of 3 years ended. He broke up with her after the sex between them diminished to being non-existent after the first year. She told me that sex is easier for her in the beginning when emotions are running high but she still needs to force herself to have it. I knew they broke up due to irresolvable differences but I didn't ask for details nor did she tell me. After a lot of apologies and crying she told me that I was the first person she was able to \"tolerate\" sex with for so long and that she did enjoy it a handful of times; but after a while she still felt like she \"was being raped\". I broke down after hearing this and started kicking myself for not catching on to any of this. She said she tried her best to please me as much as she could. \n\n&#x200B; \n\n2. She still doesn't want a divorce and she doesn't want the house, cars, or the savings; she just wants me and is ready to do whatever it takes to keep me. She even said that she would sign a postnup stating this. \n\n&#x200B; \n\n3. As for her friend, she was there during her last breakup and helped to support her though it. My wife went to her after I brought up divorce and talked things out. Her friend suggested that she open the relationship for me but she said she didn't want me sleeping with strange women so her friend volunteered herself to be the one that sleeps with me; my wife thought this was a great idea which led to the fiasco at our house. I won't comment on her appearance because it doesn't matter, and I don't blame the friend. \n\n&#x200B; \n\n4. My lawyer got back to me, you were all right. I don't need to her permission but I will have to wait if I want to push it through. \n\n&#x200B; \n\n5. I aske her why she lied to me to me this entire time and she said she was tired of being rejected after revealing she was asexual so she convinced herself that she would be able to force herself to have sex during the relationship. The hormone testing, the sessions in couples therapy , and all of our \"solutions\" was just her buying time to find another way around sex or give herself enough time to build up the strength to start regularly having sex with me again. \n\n&#x200B; \n\n6. Our conversation ended with us holding each other in bed crying for a couple of hours. No we didn't have sex. She pleaded with me to hold off on the divorce to look for a solution together and left my hotel room. \n\n&#x200B; \n\n7. I'm now sitting alone typing this fucking post. I guess I found out that we don't share everything with each other. \n\n&#x200B; \n\n8. Thank you to everyone who has messaged me directly, I'm still trying to get to all of them. \n\n&#x200B; \n\n9. I don't know what I'm going to do. \n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS** \n\n**How long has the wife knew about the divorce** \n\n**OOP** \n\n>We lightly touched on the subject 4 months prior to getting served.\u00a0 The final push was when she discovered that she was asexual, I brought up divorce at that time but she didn't want to talk about it and said she won't consider a divorce.\u00a0 I was stonewalled from that specific conversation.\u00a0 I filed anyway, it was the first time she refused to talk to me about any subject.\u00a0\u00a0 I was surprised since we share literally everything with each other. \n\n**Is it a medical issue?** \n\n**OOP** \n\n>If it was a medical issue I wouldn't have made this post and I'd be by my wife's side right now.\u00a0 But it isn't the case, and sex is how I show and feel my love.\u00a0 We only get to do this being a human thing once and sex is important to me. \n\n**Is she depressed?** \n\n**OOP** \n\n>I don't think she's depressed, I'm sure her therapist would have caught it or she would have told me, but I can't be sure now.\u00a0 Other than sex, things have been normal.\u00a0 I can't imagine that we missed anything, she really did put in a ton of effort.\u00a0 We both did/do.\u00a0 But thank you, I know we'll both be fine, but I figure it's better to do this now before we accidentally have children. \n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/s/RP60A7WSn5)\u00a0 **March 13, 2024**\n\n\nI don't think I can link my previous post so just go to my profile I guess if you care to read the op.\u00a0 I've tried to read every comment/message and take to heart what most of you had to say.\u00a0 Also please stop messaging me, I can't respond to everyone; it's too much.\u00a0 I'll make this as short as possible. \n\n\nAfter my last update, my wife asked me to meet with her about a week later to discuss things with her.\u00a0 I've been staying at an extended stay\u00a0 since that night with her friend.\u00a0 We met at our house and talked for a few hours.\u00a0 She started off with a ton of apologies for how she acted, her lying about her sexuality, and not taking my sexual needs more seriously.\u00a0 Before I could say anything she presented a signed postnup agreement she had drafted with a lawyer stating that she doesn't want anything, the house, the cars, savings, everything.\u00a0 I felt like the biggest asshole for thinking that she was tricking me for more money.\u00a0\u00a0 I asked her if she was serious and she told me to take the postnup with me and sign it when I'm ready.\u00a0 (I still haven't signed it, it's in my backpack) \n\nI told her that I still think divorce is our best course of action and that we both deserve to find someone who matches our needs.\u00a0 She still refused and borderline begged me to reconsider, she started crying and so did I.\u00a0 Seeing her like this was devastating.\u00a0 I told her that her finding other women to sleep with me wasn't going to work.\u00a0 What if I develop feelings for them?\u00a0 What if I get one of them pregnant?\u00a0 Do we expect her to get an abortion?\u00a0 She said we'll \"figure it out as we go along\" and to please give her more time to work on other solutions.\u00a0 She's set up appointments for sex and hormone therapy, and it's seeing a sex guru.\u00a0 I said that it sounds like we're going through the same things again but she was adamant and pleaded with me to wait.\u00a0 There were more apologies on both sides and we kissed for a while before ending the conversation, then I went back to my hotel that night.\u00a0 \n\nA few days later I tried texting her but she didn't respond, so I called her dad (I'm avoiding her mother and sister since they are saying the same things as my wife).\u00a0\u00a0 Her dad told me that she moved back home and has been holed up in her room since our talk, she called out of work.\u00a0\u00a0 He told me that she's barely eating, bathing, or talking to him or her mom.\u00a0 He asked me what I was going to do but I didn't have an answer for him.\u00a0 He just said he understands and said he would be here to talk anytime I wanted to.\u00a0 So I went back to our house and a good portion of her stuff was gone, the whole place feels empty.\u00a0 I've been sleeping in one of the spare rooms.\u00a0 \n\nI'm planning on flying to my mother's house in a couple weeks to spend time with my family to decompress from this entire situation.\u00a0 I'm still on the divorce side of the fence but I guess there's no rush.\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you to everyone for your insight and concern, seriously, I know we're all strangers but most of you have been a huge help to my mental health.\u00a0 Seriously, thank you.\u00a0 \n\nAlso my cousin uses reddit and reached out after he found my last post and asked me to shout him out if I made an update.\u00a0 Love you Virgil, thank you for being there for me. \n\nI think I'll just make a quick edit to this post once we reach a resolution for anyone that cares.\u00a0 \n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP**",

Our marriage began to deteriorate after there was a significant drop in sex between us, not intimacy, just the actual sex part of the relationship.  We would still cuddle and have deep intimate moments talking and just being around each other but she kept rejecting my attempts at taking things further past kissing.  Now we have had no problem communicating so I made sure to address it early, and we talked and made adjustments.  We both made sure to stay in shape, we tried being more adventurous, we went to couples therapy/counseling, and even tested both of our hormone levels(everything was normal).  Each \"solution\" would work for a little while and then we'd be back to having sex maybe once a month.  I asked her several times if she was no longer attracted to me, to which she denied every time.  I asked her if I was falling short in the relationship in any other way, to which she said no.  \n\nWell about a month ago, she gets back from her therapy session and tells me that she believes that she's asexual and that's the reason for her libido being non-existent as of late.  I was definitely confused because we had such great sex for a while in the beginning of our relationship but her telling me that she's now asexual was heartbreaking because everything else is great.  Obviously I'm not going to force her to have sex, so we had a long conversation about our relationship and I came to the conclusion that we should get a divorce.  I say \"I\" because she immediately rejected the idea and said we would figure something out and wouldn't talk to me about it anymore.  I didn't know what to say so I dropped it.  Well three weeks go by (without sex) and I decided that I have to do this for my own mental well-being so I filed for divorce and had her served with the papers.  \n\nLast week when I got home from work, she was going about the day like nothing was wrong.

The Palestinian people supported Hamas more after the October 7th attacks, which were a blatant act of terrorism, and it's clear the goal was to cause as many people as they could to die, regardless of whether or not they were IDF.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nHamas is fairly good at propaganda, inside and outside of Palestine. They've convinced people that there is genocide. This makes no sense to me, considering the civilian-militant death ratio is below average for urban warfare. The average urban war has a civilian-militant death ratio of 9:1, yet most sources estimate the ratio is about 2:1 in Palestine.\u00a0\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThey've also convinced people they are freedom fighters fighting for a morally just cause, when in reality they don't seem to care about the Palestinian people, even housing military targets where innocent people live.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nHamas is authoritarian and nationalistic, which is never a good combination. Yet most sources show that they are supported among Palestinians, with the low side showing, at best, a simple majority and, at worst, a supermajority.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nIt's clear that the Palestinian people do not want to accept LGBTQ people, nor do they allow for even the most basic items like women's rights.\u00a0\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI guess my question is: how can the idea of a Palestinian state even be considered when the people that would inhabit such a state do not align themselves with the values that the civilized world strives for? Even ignoring the historical arguments (which seem split pretty 50/50 to me), shouldn't we back the country that we align with most politically?\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI don't know. The whole idea seems a little naive to me, to be honest. I support self-determination too, but you have to know what that would mean for everyone. I understand Palestinians haven't had the best treatment from Israel, and I get that can be frustrating, but I think a full \"Palestinian Liberation\" would be worse in nearly every measurable metric than trying to change the values of Israel.

While most of these ideas are my own some of these are taken from the pro Palestine person. \n\nThe one state solution I find unrealistic and neither side wants it. I know my bf thinks it can eventually work and it\u2019s not impossible though it\u2019s going to be very difficult and feels neither side wants that. We pretty much avoid the subject if it does come up. \n\nMy idea: Gaza the the West Bank given back to the Palestinians and settlers in the West Bank need to be removed. Get Netanyahu out of power and the rest of the far right government and get a more moderate in power. Gantz or Yapid sound good. Concessions will have to be made on both sides. Palestinians need Hamas out its not good for Palestinians or Israelis and there needs to be a reform in the education system mostly from the palestinan side but Israeli side too. Apologies need to be made even if you don\u2019t think you\u2019re the cause. Refugee can get compensated somehow with reparations. For security I heard a proposition that sounds good. Basically like the DMZ with North Korea and South Korea there could be one for the border between Israel and Palestine. You can have the United States handle the Israel side and China and Russia handle the Palestine side. If someone dares to start another October 7th the troops respond and aid is cut off we need something that honor the security for both so both sides feel safe. That goes for either side who starts something. For the capital you can have a joint Jerusalem capital or East Jerusalem for Palestine or I\u2019ve heard one Palestinian claim the West Bank as their capital so that is another idea. There needs to be trust built between the two sides, I\u2019ve spoken to Israelis who don\u2019t believe me when I say I\u2019ve met Palestinians who want peace and I\u2019ve met some Palestinians who think Israelis don\u2019t want peace and they\u2019re lying when they say they want the war to end. \n\nNot sure if this is good or not but I\u2019m open to agreements or other suggestions. \n\n",

I reached out to my former supervisor and let them know. Said it would be taken care of and I'll be notified if they need anything. Two weeks later, didn't hear anything, received another deposit. I then notified my supervisor's supervisor. They apologized and said they'd get a hold of HR.\n\nAlmost two weeks later, HR sent me an email and informed me they were just notified of my leaving. My total take home was about $3000, but they are requiring that I pay them back about $4500!  That's my total of both paychecks before SS, taxes, 401k, etc.\n\nThey took blame for this, but that's not even remotely fair to have to pay back those taxes and everything!  So I have to be out $1500 because THEY screwed up?  Is that legal??  And of top of it all, those taxes will still be there and count against me at tax time!  Shouldn't then be required to petition the government for those funds back??\n\nThis is in Indiana if that makes a difference. Should I get a lawyer for this?  Is there anyone I can talk too??\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nAs some of you may have seen below, I posted an update earlier after talking with my tax guy.  Taking his advice,, as well as some of yours, I responded to HR in an email explaining that I was only paying back what I received (and I specifically put the dollar amount and included screenshots of my pay stubs), that they could get the state and federal stuff back through their software, I wanted proof my W2 was fixed, and I wanted confirmation of receipt of email and a specific address on where to send the certified check.  I also reminded them how this was their fault and that I had reached out to them multiple times to get the situation fixed.\n\nI week goes by, no response.  After a week and a day, I responded to the email I sent, asking for verification that it was received, only this time I put that HR persons boss on it as well.  First thing the next morning, I had an email stating they received it, where to send the check for the amount that I dictated, that they would schedule a zoom call with me and accounting to go over my W2 and how they fixed it, and that they were glad WE could come to an agreeable solution to the issue!  WE, like they had any hand in it!\n\nAnyways, going to the bank to get the check today.  i also heard that my boss and my boss's boss got in trouble for this whole situation as well.",

He would wake me up 5-10 times a night. In 2020, he did a sleep study and was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea and prescribed a CPAP. He wore the CPAP for less than a week because it was uncomfortable.\n\nThroughout the years, I have spent hundreds of dollars on over the counter sleep meds and ear plugs to try and sleep. I've tried calmly to speak to my husband over the years about this, but it has been met with:\n\n\"You're just a light sleeper.\" \"I'm not talking about this/why are we talking about this?\" \"Married people should sleep in the same bed.\"\n\nI haven't always handled this the best. I've gotten very frustrated and yelled at him in the middle of the night. I'm working on putting my thoughts out calmly.\n\nSummer of 2022, I was pregnant and my therapist recommended strongly I sleep elsewhere. I was nervous but I moved to our guest room across the hall. A few months ago, I moved to the basement because his snoring was still waking me up. This has provided better sleep but a horrible effect to my mental health.\n\nI have frequently encouraged him to go back to the doctor about his sleep apnea - possibly try another CPAP or explore other options. I'm also concerned on the affects of untreated sleep apnea on his physical and mental health. I tell him I want to sleep in the same bed as much as he does. I know many couples find success in separate bedrooms but he has made it clear that he is not interested in that.\n\nRecently he mentioned \"I bet even if I fixed my snoring, you wouldn't sleep in the same bed as me.\" I was stunned. Me toughing it out for over 3 years shows the opposite, in my opinion.\n\nHe finally offered to switch and let me sleep in our bed, and 3 days later he's complaining on how he can't do it.\n\nHe keeps stringing me along about going to the doctor. I don't think he actually plans to go. His complete disregard for my sleep over the years is incredibly hurtful. He refusal to fix an easily fixable problem is mind boggling.\n\nMy question - should I give him an ultimatum to fix his sleep apnea or I'm out? I am considering divorce. Are ultimatums ever healthy? I need advice on how to deal with this.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**RO489:** Would he be willing to talk to a therapist about this together? Try to unpack some of the reasons he\u2019s digging in?\n\nIs he obese? Can losing weight or nasal surgery be an option?\n\n> **OOP:** He was just in therapy and I don't know if they discussed it. He is overweight, but not obese.\n> \n> And I hope so. I'm going to ask him if he would consider going to marriage counseling.\n\n**Has OOP looked into other factors leading to her husband\u2019s sleeping problems?**\n\n> **OOP:** Tonsils could definitely be a factor - I know he has had issues with them in the past. He rarely drinks - but when he does, boy does he snore even louder! He could lose some weight but is not obese.\n> \n> He is for now sleeping in the basement, but I am afraid he is going to get more and more angry with me as time goes on. And then I will have to deal with his wrath.\n\n**Does OOP and her husband have children and if his sleeping apnea has affected them?**\n\n> **OOP:** Yes we have a 1 yr old.\n> \n> I do agree - i'm worried about his health, but also I want to be able to travel and take my daughter places. How are we going to be able to do that if me and my daughter can't sleep due to his snoring in a hotel room?\n> \n> It just seems to be infiltrating so many aspects of our lives.\n\n**UncomfortableBike975:** He needs a cpap. Make an appointment with a pulmonologist. Make sure he goes. It may take time to find a mask that works for him, but he will feel soooo much better in the morning.\n\n> **OOP:** He has a CPAP but won't wear it. He would be furious if I made an appointment for him.\n\n**OOP on her husband\u2019s family history and if it plays a significant role in his health**\n\n> **OOP:** It's so sad because his father died relatively young due to not taking care of his health. But my husband is not putting two and two together.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/MYdbGVYNqA): **August 20, 2024 (7 months later)**\n\nEdit: everyone saying that he needs a CPAP, I agree. This is what I've told him for five years.\n\nEveryone that's saying he should try this\u2026 I guarantee you I've presented that as a solution for him. The inspire implant, BIPAP, mouth guards, surgery etc. He insists that he will only try the CPAP. I've suggested different masks and he's reluctant but he's tried two different ones.\n\nI do appreciate all your support and suggestions, though. \u2764\ufe0f I guess I made this post just venting. I don't really know why I made it.\ud83d\ude02\n\nI sat down with him and I gave an ultimatum. I told him that he needs to treat his sleep apnea or i will divorce him. He didn't say much. We will see what he does with it. End edit.\n\nUpdate is.... there is no update. I am considering filing for divorce by the end of the year if this doesn't get resolved.\n\nFor the past five years, my husband's sleep apnea has been a significant challenge in our marriage. Initially, I slept next to him, but his snoring made it difficult for me to get restful sleep. Despite trying different solutions like earplugs, my sleep continued to suffer.\n\nWhen I became pregnant, I reached a point where I couldn't handle the lack of sleep anymore. On my therapist's recommendation, I decided to move to the spare room across the hall, and we've been sleeping separately for the last two years.\n\nA year ago, his snoring became so loud that it started waking me up from across the hall, forcing me to move to the basement to get some rest. Unfortunately, sleeping in the basement took a toll on my mental health.\n\nAfter several conversations with him about my concerns, I expressed that I didn't want to sleep in the basement anymore and asked him to see a doctor for his sleep apnea. Instead, he started sleeping in the basement himself, which felt like a temporary fix rather than a long-term solution.\n\nThe issue persists, especially when we travel, as our daughter and I end up sharing a room with him, and his snoring makes it difficult for us to sleep. I'm increasingly concerned about how this might affect our daughter's sleep as well.\n\nI recently sat down with him to express my concerns about his health and the impact this situation is having on our marriage. I shared that I was worried about the potential long-term consequences, both for him and for our relationship because I have read studies that state that people die in their early 30's with untreated severe sleep apnea.\n\nIn response, he made a comment that deeply upset me. He laughed and said \"At least I have 10 more years.\" Though I\u2019ve tried to stay calm throughout this, I couldn't hold back my frustration in that moment.\n\nAfter I lost it, he did go to the doctor and got a new CPAP machine, but wearing it consistently has been a challenge for him. There have been various excuses about its discomfort, and despite his insistence that the CPAP is the only option, he hasn't been able to wear it through the night.\n\nWe tried sleeping in the same bed again, but I found myself waking up multiple times to remind him to put the CPAP back on. After two weeks of disrupted sleep, I realized that he was taking the CPAP off as soon as I fell asleep, and I had to return to the basement.\n\nLately, I've noticed through reports on the CPAP machine that he hasn't been wearing the CPAP at all, which has left me feeling incredibly frustrated and helpless.

I'm trying to stay calm and find the right words to express my feelings, but if we can't resolve this, I may need to consider other options for my own well-being.\n\n**Additional Information from OOP after seeing counseling questions**\n\n> **OOP:** You're entitled to your own opinion but I have exhausted every option I can think of in the name of \"for better or for worse\".\n> \n> Marriage counseling\n> Individual counseling\n> Not getting a good nights sleep in my own bed for over 5 years\n> Hours of research, hundreds of conversations where I told him how much I loved him and how we could fix this issue TOGETHER\n> Hundreds of dollars put into different things (earplugs etc.) to try and sleep in the same bed\n> Sleeping in the basement of my own house\n> Doing most of the housework and childcare\n> \n> This is by far more than an inconvenience to me. I don't know, after 5 years of waiting, encouraging, researching and talking how much more I could have contributed. I have fully taken this on as OUR problem but the one thing I can't do is wear the CPAP for him. Or get a surgery. Or go to a doctor.\n> \n> At first glance, your statement could be a valid opinion. But walk 5 years in my shoes, with a daughter that depends on you, and you might be saying something different.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**OOP on the wedding vows regarding sickness and health**\n\n> **OOP:** I think you make a good point about sickness and in health.\n> \n> I do agree with that sentiment, but what if his sickness is easily treatable and he chooses not to treat it despite the havoc it is wreaking on our marriage?\n> \n> I hear you and that's why I haven't left yet. It's confusing and I feel like I'm in a tough spot.\n\n**Honest_Weird_9715:** I totally get you. He doesn\u2019t seem to care for his own health or yours. Yes sleep apnea is dangerous and he just doesn\u2019t care because the mask is uncomfortable? Is he a child?!?!? Alone for stringing you and daughter along is infuriating. Doesn\u2019t he want to be a healthy father who is their for his daughter?\n\n> **OOP:** Everything I do is for my daughter and viewed through the lens of how this will/could affect her.\n> \n> I've been in the hospital twice, each for a few days, since she's been born for two life threatening (now resolved) issues. It killed me to be away from her, but I knew that taking care of myself was the best thing I could do.\n> \n> This is another layer to this issue I guess. I have sacrificed for my health. I guess I have resentment growing cause he won't do the same.\n\n**OOP\u2019s thoughts on how her husband is not listening or accepting her suggestions to get help with his sleep apnea**\n\n> **OOP:** Honestly, I agree with you. I appreciate everyone taking the time to comment and I know everyone's suggestions are from a wonderful place. But I have tried for five years to suggest solutions to his sleep apnea, and now I'm looking for solutions in my marriage, unhappiness and just support I guess. I've been through a lot of therapy and I've realized I can't fix anything for him.\n> \n> I've suggested surgeries, inspire, done plenty of research and he just doesn't care. He doesn't want to hear it.\n\n**OOP on the other possibilities for her husband\u2019s sleeping problems**\n\n> **OOP:** Haha actually...\n> \n> He quit smoking cigarettes, but he vapes like a fiend now.\n> \n> And he did have GERD, but he actually got that under control\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/bsFEP7ZL1d): **August 24, 2024**\n\nUpdate: My husband (28M)'s sleep apnea is ruining our marriage. (I (29F) filed for divorce) Can you give me advice moving forward?\n\nLink to original post:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/7S6BDafRUT\n\nI put down a retainer for an attorney, filled out the paper and I will be officially filing for divorce next week.\n\nI finally came to the realization, thanks to almost 900 comments on that post, some wise advice from family and friends, and a lot of introspection, that he will never change.\n\nHe has a severe lack of empathy for others. I have proof (through many texts) that I have told him his snoring has been impacting my sleep for years and he simply does not care.\n\nThis is on top of him in the past secretly opening up a credit card (spending thousand dollars on playing cards) and catching him talking to other women behind my back.\n\nI know it takes two for marriage to fail. So I am definitely reflecting on my own mistakes and contributions.\n\nMy goal going forward is giving my daughter the most calm, stable, loving environment, which I've realized is impossible while in this marriage.\n\nIf you have any advice on divorce, please give it to me straight. I've been reading up on divorce and consulting with my divorce attorney.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**Suspicious-Ad7109:** Indeed. But even if he didn't snore the gambling and cheating would be sufficient to dump him.\n\n> **OOP:** You're not wrong, but I take my commitments seriously.\n> \n> I was willing to forgive the cheating and gambling because we were going through some really hard times... even though my coping mechanisms were doubling my salary, getting my MBA online and throwing myself into being the best mom I could be... and his coping mechanisms were.... that. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n> \n> I feel like I've been in denial for so long and am finally waking up.\n\n**HomelyHobbit:** Good luck to you - divorce is hell, but not as much hell as staying in the wrong marriage. A year or two from now you'll be so happy you got the ball rolling!\n\n> **OOP:** I'm no stranger to hard times. I know it's about to get rough, but I'm committed to being as peaceful as I can be without being a pushover.\n> \n> I just feel like nothing can be harder than being in this marriage\n\n**OOP on why she is willing to divorce her husband over his snoring problems**\n\n> **OOP:** I am aware it is something he cannot control.\n> \n> It's more than just snoring - he is stopping breathing in his sleep over 60 times an hour. I slept with him for 3 years trying to make it work. Now his snoring has gotten so bad, I'm in the basement and it is still waking me up.\n> \n> He knows he is risking his life and his daughter could be without her father. He knows it's caused me years of sleep deprivation. He knows there are many available and relatively easy fixes. He doesn't care.\n> \n> I've had hundreds of conversations, spent hundreds of dollars on ear plugs and other things to help me sleep. I've done my due diligence in trying to get him fix this problem.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# **DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs \u2013 BoRU Rule #7**\n\n# **THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**",

            "body": "**Update** :  \n\nTLDR: I told him either wear his CPAP or I'm out. He said OK. He wouldn't hold  our agreement for one day so I left.\n\nLast night, after reading all of your messages I sat down and I gave him an ultimatum - either he wears his CPAP/pursues another solution or I want a divorce. We have a daughter and she deserves her dad. He really didn't say anything other than OK. A few hours later I asked him what the plan was and he said  the same as it has been, wear his CPAP. \n\nToday, the machine said he wore it for two hours last night. He had said he wore it all night. Ok the machine might be wrong or may have reset during the night - I asked if we could see on the CPAP app on his phone? He said no.\n\nThat started a fight that ended in me realizing he's not going to change.\nHe probably did only wear it for 2 hours last night and is lying. He is not upholding his part  which included communicating his progress on the very first day. \n\nI said I was done. I want a divorce. I asked him to leave. He said no. I ended up packing up my daughter and we went to a hotel. I'm not leaving her. I feel guilty about this, but I was worried it was going to escalate and I needed to get away from him. \n\nMoving forward, I'm going to try to find a short term rental until I can buy a house of my own. I don't want to stay with him any longer and he's made it clear he's not leaving.  Then we can sell our current house. I'm going to meet with a divorce lawyer this week. \n\nThe good thing is, I work from home and I make more than enough to support myself and my daughter. I also just completed my MBA and will hopefully be using that soon. \n\nThank you for all your perspectives, time and words of support as well as giving it to me straight. My only girl this life is to be a good mom and I'm just trying to set a good example for my daughter. \n\nPrevious edit: everyone saying that he needs a CPAP, I agree. This is what I've told him for five years.\n\nEveryone that's saying he should try this\u2026 I guarantee you I've presented  that as a solution for him. The inspire implant, BIPAP, mouth guards, surgery etc. He insists that he will only try the CPAP. I've suggested different masks and he's reluctant but he's tried two different ones.\n\nI do appreciate all your support and suggestions, though. \u2764\ufe0f I guess I made this post just venting. I don't really know why I made it.\ud83d\ude02\n\nI sat down with him and I gave an ultimatum. I told him that he needs to treat his sleep apnea or i will divorce him.  He didn't say much. We will see what he does with it. End edit. \n\n\n\nUpdate is.... there is no update. I am considering filing for divorce by the end of the year if this doesn't get resolved. \n\nFor the past five years, my husband's sleep apnea has been a significant challenge in our marriage. Initially, I slept next to him, but his snoring made it difficult for me to get restful sleep. Despite trying different solutions like earplugs, my sleep continued to suffer.\n\nWhen I became pregnant, I reached a point where I couldn't handle the lack of sleep anymore. On my therapist's recommendation, I decided to move to the spare room across the hall, and we've been sleeping separately for the last two years.\n\nA year ago, his snoring became so loud that it started waking me up from across the hall, forcing me to move to the basement to get some rest. Unfortunately, sleeping in the basement took a toll on my mental health.\n\nAfter several conversations with him about my concerns, I expressed that I didn't want to sleep in the basement anymore and asked him to see a doctor for his sleep apnea. Instead, he started sleeping in the basement himself, which felt like a temporary fix rather than a long-term solution.\n\nThe issue persists, especially when we travel, as our daughter and I end up sharing a room with him, and his snoring makes it difficult for us to sleep. I'm increasingly concerned about how this might affect our daughter's sleep as well.\n\nI recently sat down with him to express my concerns about his health and the impact this situation is having on our marriage. I shared that I was worried about the potential long-term consequences, both for him and for our relationship because I have read studies that state that people die in their early 30's with untreated severe sleep apnea. \n\nIn response, he made a comment that deeply upset me. He laughed and said \"At least I have 10 more years.\"  Though I\u2019ve tried to stay calm throughout this, I couldn't hold back my frustration in that moment.\n\nAfter I lost it, he did go to the doctor and got a new CPAP machine, but wearing it consistently has been a challenge for him. There have been various excuses about its discomfort, and despite his insistence that the CPAP is the only option, he hasn't been able to wear it through the night.\n\nWe tried sleeping in the same bed again, but I found myself waking up multiple times to remind him to put the CPAP back on. After two weeks of disrupted sleep, I realized that he was taking the CPAP off as soon as I fell asleep, and I had to return to the basement.\n\nLately, I've noticed through reports on the CPAP machine that he hasn't been wearing the CPAP at all, which has left me feeling incredibly frustrated and helpless. I feel like its creating a huge wedge in our relationship and making me feel unattracted to him. \n\nThis has been an ongoing issue for five years, and I\u2019m struggling to see how I can continue living like this for another five. I'm trying to stay calm and find the right words to express my feelings, but if we can't resolve this, I may need to consider other options for my own well-being.",

It was extremely traumatic\u2014I\u2019m an now in weekly therapy for postnatal ptsd and ppd. I also have physical therapy from torn abdominal muscles from the pregnancy and much more. I love my girls, but it\u2019s been very hard.\n\nFor the last 5mnths I have asked my husband if he would get a vasectomy. I cannot get hormonal birth control (health reasons) and just the idea of getting anything inserted now, due to the trauma literally makes me vomit. I am given laughing gas and anxiety meds just to get checkups now. (And it just so happens that are twins were created from a broken condom.)\n\nMy husband\u2019s responds has been \u2018I will, later\u2019 \u2026until two days ago when I asked him and he yelled that he would \u2018never get it done\u2019.\n\nWe have not had sex since the birth. Well, once, but that was traumatic on its own.\n\nI asked him why, and he didn\u2019t have an answer and just told me to drop it. I told him we wouldn\u2019t be having sex again then, and he just looked at me flabbergasted. I\u2019ve moved to the guest bedroom, because he\u2019s been \u2018flirting\u2019 and trying to initiate intact with me since I said this.\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s his body, but I\u2019m not sure I can stay with him when he clearly has no care or appreciation for what my body or my mental state did to bringing our children into this world\u2014I love him but this really feels like a lacking in his love for me and I\u2019m not sure I can forgive him for it.\n\nHow do I explain to him that the idea of him simply being able to get me pregnant again makes my skin crawl and nausea to nearly choke me, that sometimes when he touches me as much as I enjoy it it gives me goosebumps\u2026and not in a good way\u2014I tried once before and I literally cried quietly into the pillow the whole time because the fear and anxiety was so acute. I didn\u2019t tell him this because I didn\u2019t want him to feel guilty.\n\nThis isn\u2019t going away any time soon. Maybe the ppd will fade, but the ptsd is something I will likely be working through with my therapist for years.\n\nHow do I explain this to him? How to I rectify our relationship with this if we can\u2019t have sex? Is this even worth attempting to rectify, because to me it really feels like he doesn\u2019t care about me since I constantly makes it clear that he doesn\u2019t want any more kids.\n\nEDIT: (I was told to add this to my post) I cannot mentally or physically/medically have any invasive surgical contraceptive procedures done in the near or foreseeable future as stated by multiple obgyns. No, I am no going to go any more into depth on my medical history or why. Yes, my husband knows this and have heard this stated by my doctors. I have also had a traumatic incident prior to the birth of my twins with a copper iud that needed to be removed surgically.\n\nEDIT 2: He will not go to therapy. His parents were therapist and it has left a bad taste for therapy. He refuses.\n\nFINAL EDIT: Honestly I read a lot of responses\u2026almost all of them I would say. And there were the middle ground people and the \u2018you can\u2019t force him\u2019 people and the \u2018your husband doesn\u2019t care about you\u2019 people.\n\nI wasn\u2019t forcing him. I was begging him. For empathy over what I did and gave up to bring our children into this world. For a show of caring for the trauma it left me. And to know that he would be there for me in sickness and in health. He has stated so many times that he does not want more children. Even that we \u2018have one too many\u2019 now.\n\nI\u2019m also not \u2018punishing him by withholding sex\u2019 clearly do not understand ptsd\u2026or most importantly, that my body isn\u2019t his, and he does not have a right to sex with me. I cannot withhold something that is no his.\n\nI\u2019m going to take some time away from my husband, because honestly reading these responses have not given me any more insight into why he would be willing to risk my health and mental state to avoid a vasectomy\u2014when I know if the situations were reversed, I would do that for him. And frankly HAVE. When I attempted to get a copper IUD because he didn\u2019t like the feeling over condoms early on in our relationship, even though I was scared\u2026and it left me passed out on the floor of the doctors from pain, and then two days later in the emergency room because it had done damage and I was bleeding excessively.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the man I married, or I didn\u2019t think it was. Otherwise I would have never risked all that I did for him, or given all these years to him.\n\n(And since this is a constant thing coming-up. As stated in multiple comments and in my last edit I cannot get my tubs tied both for mental/emotional reasons, and medical/physical reason as made clear to me by 2 separate obgyns.)\n\nAnd to all the men here telling me that him getting a vasectomy won\u2019t help and saying they if I leave him I\u2019d never find anyone who would take me. Thanks. I\u2019m bi, and I certainly would never date a man again.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**Commentator:** You can\u2019t force it but you can absolutely say no sex or none without a condom. That\u2019s well within your rights.\n\nAlthough if that is the solution is that a viable relationship solution. I don\u2019t think so personally\n\n>**OP:** A broken condom is what got me pregnant. I could not imagine risking that again.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18cgo0v/update_my_30f_husband_30m_wont_get_a_vasectomy/?share_id=KccLIrR1cZvE2g6EP3Mg9&utm_content=1&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) - **December 6, 2023** \n\nI just found this account so if anyone cares, here\u2019s an update.\n\nWe are weeks from our official divorce. It was a deal breaker for and a lack of care for my personal and mental well-being a new a disrespect towards what I\u2019d given up to have our children. I couldn\u2019t get over it. He kept trying to pretend it wasn\u2019t as bad as it was, but inevitably much like you all said, it was his choice. And this was mine.\n\nI am unfortunately considering filing some sort a restraining order however as he had been making accounts to \u2018talk sense into me\u2019 through most of my socials.\n\nI actually hadn\u2019t reread my post in a year and got to the end and had a good laugh, I am actually currently dating a lovely woman. It\u2019s only been a few weeks but we knew each other her from college, and just reconnected a month ago. It\u2019s going very slow, I have twins but she\u2019s been a saint honestly, to come back to my posts topic, It is lifechanging for my stress to know that she cannot get me pregnant, not that we been very intimate yet.\n\nAnyway, not sure anyone cares but there it is. I\u2019m in a much better place than I was, I feel better. My twins are happy. And we\u2019ve been co-parenting decently well other than the social media thing.\n\nEdit: I think I'm going to step away now. But my advice. Don't let your partners use you as a humam shield for all the physical reproccussions of reproduction. Partnership is a give and take of equal sacrifices, and that\u2019s not the case if he is all to comfortable for you to be the only one taking on the physical sacrifice. We do enough bringing children into the world. Your not expecting too much for him to be willing to take the same risks he expects of you.\n\nI\u2019m happy and healthy, my twins are happy and healthy, thanks for all your well wishes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS** \n\n**Careless_Dentist_287:** Man or woman has nothing to do with it. One person in the relationship is wanting someone to do something they don\u2019t want to do. And that something involves going under the knife and losing your ability to have children, that\u2019s a big deal.\n\n>**OP:** I does, because on top of all procedures for us being more invasive dangerous and having longer healing times. We also take on ALL of the physical dangerous of reproduction in general.\n>\n>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s insane to expect a man to take on some part of the reproductive responsibilities.\n>\n>Thanks.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB \u2013 I AM NOT OOP.**",

            "body": "The question at the heart of the Israel-Palestine conflict is the causal relationship between Israeli security measures and Palestinian violence. Are Palestinians violent because Israel imposes burdensome security measures, or does Israel impose burdensome security measures because the Palestinians are violent?\n\nAbout 20 years ago, Israel tested the perfect experiment. During 1967-2005, Gaza was under an Israeli military occupation. The Palestinians had little or no say over their politics. Then, in 2005, Israel withdrew from Gaza, virtually leaving the Palestinians to their own devices. Hamas, a murderous, Islamist movement, seized power, and has since initiated rounds of violence with Israel.\n\nYes, Gaza has been under a blockade since disengagement. But critics of Israel typically blow this out of proportion. It isn't easy, but Palestinians can and do leave Gaza (and return). The impact of the blockade can probably be measured by looking at Gaza's life expectancy. [It's about 75 years, which is pretty good for a developing country.](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/gaza-strip/) Child mortality is also fine. These objective, encompassing figures don't describe a besieged, starving population.\n\nI think Coleman Hughes said something along the lines of, \"Gaza is 90% of the way to sovereignty and returned the favor by murdering 1200 people. It isn't logical to say, 'Let's give Gaza that final 10%, and we'll arrive at peace.'\"\n\nHow do you argue with that? Israel can't prevent Gaza from ratifying a constitution, implementing its own legal system, distributing welfare or a million other things that autonomous states do. That is not the case for the West Bank, where there is an Israeli military presence. Palestinians are arrested and incarcerated by the thousand, they can't go wherever they want whenever they want, and they have to share the land with hostile Jewish neighbors. But it's Gaza that threatens Israel, and the West Bank has been quiet for 20 years. Doesn't this prove that Israeli security measures are necessary and achieve their objective? Why wouldn't an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank turn it into a larger Gaza?",

Wage war against the new nation of Israel. Lose more land than the partition gave them.\n\n1967: Israel wins yet another war against its Arab neighbors, conquering Gaza, the West Bank and Sinai in a defensive war. The Arab League declares the \"three no's\": No peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with Israel. Israel voluntarily hands control of the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism back to the Islamic Waqf, and made it illegal for Jews to pray there.\n\n1979: Israel voluntarily hands the Sinai back to Egypt, returning land conquered in a defensive war.\n\n1993: Israel recognizes the sovereignty of the Palestinian Authority over the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the Oslo Accords. Yasser Arafat uses it to support terrorism.\n\n2000: Israel offers Yasser Arafat recognition of a Palestinian state in all of Gaza and 94% of the West Bank with East Jerusalem as its Capital. Arafat rejects it and launches the Second Intifada.\n\n2005: Israel pulls out of the Gaza Strip, dismantles all its settlements, and forces Jews to leave their homes. Palestinians respond by electing Hamas who turn it into a terror state.\n\n2008: Israel offers Mahmoud Abbas once again recognition of a Palestinian state in all of Gaza and 94% of the West Bank with East Jerusalem as its Capital and even offered to dismantle all their settlements. And once again, the Palestinians reject it.\n\n2010-2021: Hamas launches periodic rocket attacks against the state of Israel and builds terror tunnels in order to kidnap and murder Jews while using the people of Gaza as human shields against the IDF.\n\n2023: Hamas commits the worst act of mass murder against Jews since the Holocaust\n\n\nNow my opinion:\n\nThe \u201cvictimhood\u201d due to israel story is over stated and the vast majority of hardships faced by Gaza citizens  have been directly caused by Hamas. Gaza citizens  elected Hamas, they support Hamas, they celebrate the deaths of innocents, and train each new generation to hate Jews. All while  Israel still bends over backwards to avoid civilian casualties, by sounding alarms, giving multiday notices at times, mass texting gaza citizens they are going to attack. While  Hamas  intentionally inflicts civilian casualties as a matter of official policy which is supported and cheered by gaza citizens.\n\nHamas does not want a two state solution they want a final solution. Which is the complete extermination of all Jews in Israel.",

They're 72 and 75 year old cancer patients scratching off a bucket list trip to South Africa while they still can.  They paid for Delta 1 tickets, boarded to find their seats occupied, were offered economy seats in the back of the plane with no offer of compensation other than an insulting lowball of 50,000 miles - which was not reasonable compensation, as their poor health and comfort is not accommodated by a trivial mileage award.  And then they were threatened with removal.  \n\nThis is a fucking garbage-tier airline.  Absolute clown show nonsense. \n\nLetter to customer service: \n\n  \nOur first Delta experience began in COS. In ATL we waited in the Skymiles lounge. When flight 210 was called we reported to the gate and boarded with Group 1. At no point were we contacted or informed concerning problems in our trip reservation, itinerary or seating. Our boarding pass read Delta 1 seats 2B and 2C.Once on board we were denied access to our seats which appeared to be occupied. The flight attendant said we had been downgraded to seats 38B and 38C in the back of the plane. We politely explained that the change was unacceptable to us as we had booked and paid for Delta 1 seats.\u00a0 The crew was understanding, but they said they needed supervisory assistance to effect a solution.\u00a0\n\nWe were left standing in the entrance of the plane, holding our carry on items while all of the passengers boarded. Although empathetic, the flight attendants told us we must wait for the \u201cRed Coats\u201d to resolve our seating issue. Rose, the first Red Coat to address us, offered us 50,000 miles to move to the back of the plane. This was not acceptable to us. She stated that 50,000 miles was the limit she was authorized to offer.\u00a0The next Delta employee in a Red Coat did not introduce herself. Her demeanor was nervous and abrupt. Other passengers were listening. We spoke quietly, she began to lose her composure. At that point she started to threaten us. We were told we must take the seats in the back of the plane, or she would call the Sky Marshals to forcibly remove us \u201cbefore the flight times out\u201d.\u00a0 We would be detained, prosecuted and placed on a permanent \u201cNo Fly List\u201d.\n\nAlthough we recognized this as a blind threat, the fact was that the next Delta flight to Cape Town was three days out. We had committed to all of our travel arrangements in South Africa. We believed our only path was to submit to taking the seating downgrade without having an agreement in place regarding compensation.\u00a0We sat in separate seats with masks on and arrived exhausted upon arrival in Cape Town. A number of crew members approached us with concern and condolences about the way we had been treated. We compliment their kindness and professionalism.\u00a0We live in Colorado and are new customers. We were enthusiastic to have found a \u201cnew to us\u201d international carrier. At the time we booked these flights we signed up for the Skymiles Amex card. Before the trip, J submitted reviews on the excellent service of two Delta employees. To that list, we would now add \\[NAME\\], a flight attendant / purser on Delta 210 who took a personal interest in what happened to us, and made every effort to make us comfortable under the circumstances.\u00a0We believe we should be reimbursed for the Delta 1 seats we paid for from Atlanta to Cape Town. We did not receive the benefit of the first class tickets, while Delta received the revenue from our seats by selling them to another customer. The seats we occupied in the back of the plane were unsold and empty at take off.\u00a0 It seems obvious and right that we should receive full credit for the ATL - CPT potion of our reservation, especially in view of the way the situation was handled aboard the aircraft.\u00a0We have put a lot of time into preparing this letter to illustrate the many failures in customer service that occurred during this incident.\u00a0 We hope you respond promptly and positively.\u00a0",

            "body": "There persists a Problem.\n\n\n\nTime and time again, organics create beings so advanced that they overpower their creators. In mankind's Cycle, this issue has been duplicated ad nauseum. The Quarians created the intelligent Geth, whose conflict with them caused the Morning Wars. The Salarians prematurely uplifted the warmongering Krogan, which led to the Krogan Rebellions. Even the Reapers themselves were a creation of the Leviathan, eventually overpowering their masters and decimating the Leviathan population. These wars are the Problem that plagues the Milky Way Galaxy, but for every Problem, there exists multiple solutions.\n\n\n\nDestroy, Control, Synthesis. These three words define every ending a Mass Effect player has ever experienced. But while this choice may be the last in the trilogy, it is not the first time Shepard has made this decision. In fact, the themes of Destroy, Control, and Synthesis are explored in all three major Mass Effect 2 DLC missions, namely the Arrival, Shadow Broker, and Overlord DLC respectively. Mass Effect 2's DLCs represent each of Mass Effect 3's endings, with each DLC conveying how resolving the Problem of the Reapers is more morally dubious than it may seem.\n\nHere are each of those major DLC missions and the endings that they explore:\n\n# Destroy: The Arrival\n\n[Shepard presses the button that sentences 304,942 Batarians to their death](https://preview.redd.it/q2yv7ipjw6rd1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=765b6727816bad6a85addc1cb5dab5eabe511017)\n\nIn the Arrival DLC, Shepard's killing of 300.000 Batarians in order to delay the Reapers is reminiscent of Shepard sacrificing the life of synthetics to defeat the Reapers. After being rescued by Shepard, Alliance Scientist Kenson reveals that in two days, the Reapers are using the Alpha Relay to invade the Milky Way. Her solution to their arrival: hurl a massive asteroid at the Relay to destroy it and delay the Reapers. The destruction of the Relay, however, would kill 300,000 innocent Batarians who reside on the asteroid. This moral quandary is an example of the Trolley Problem: is it morally responsible to kill thousands of Batarians if doing nothing would most certainly kill countless more lives throughout the Milky Way? Shepard's answer is yes; deciding to destroy the Relay and sacrifice thousands of Batarian lives, Shepard successfully delays the Reapers for another six months.\n\nShepard's decision isn't without consequence, however. The Council puts Shepard on house arrest leading into the events of Mass Effect 3. Still, Admiral Hackett stands by the Commander's decision, saying that Shepard \"did what you did for the best of reasons.\"\n\nThis sacrifice of Batarian lives is reprised should Shepard choose the Destroy ending in Mass Effect 3. By destroying the Reapers, Shepard also chose to destroy all synthetic life, including Geth like Legion or AI like EDE. In spite of their deaths, Hackett once more backs Shepard up, conceding that \"It will take time, but we can rebuild everything that was destroyed.\"\n\nShepard recognizes the tremendous sacrifice needed to stop the Reapers, professing this final speech at the end of the Arrival DLC:\n\n>\"Maybe we'll lose half the galaxy. Maybe more. But I will do whatever it takes to rid the galaxy of the Reaper threat. However insignificant we may be, we will fight, we will sacrifice, and we will find a way.\"\n\nIn the DLC, that \"way\" Shepard finds is killing 300,000 Batarians. In Mass Effect 3, that \"way\" is the death of countless Synthetic lives.\n\nFor both the DLC and in the Destroy ending, Shepard decides that the needs of the many outweigh the few, doing whatever it would take to stop the Reapers.\n\n# Control: Lair of the Shadow Broker\n\n[Liara seizes control of the Broker's network, and in doing so becomes the Broker herself](https://preview.redd.it/tyim5svow6rd1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51371fb981cbaafda54590e9d634102bbdf80219)\n\nIn the Broker DLC, Liara's usurping of the Shadow Broker only to become the Shadow Broker herself is reminiscent of how Shepard takes control of the Reapers at the Crucible.\n\nShepard's defeat of The Shadow Broker left a massive power vacuum in the Broker's wake. But rather than *destroy* the Broker's network and his many valuable contracts, Liara decides to assume the role of the Broker herself. She orders the Broker's agents to continue business as usual, and orders them to provide Liara (and by extension Shepard) with valuable information. By *controlling* the Broker's information network, Liara receives vital intel during the Reaper War, including information that led Shepard into activating the Crucible, a mega-weapon that defeats the Reapers.\n\nOriginally, Shepard may question Liara's decision. Even Liara concedes that the power she has is inherently dangerous, stating that \"In just 10 minutes, I could start a war.\"  Despite this, Liara reiterates the power of this information, replying that \"It was either that or lose everything: his contacts, his trading sources. Those will really help us.\" Liara contends that destroying power no one else has is a waste, acknowledging the unique utility of the Broker's network.\n\nJust as Liara seized control of the Broker's agents, Shepard seized control of the Reapers in the Control Ending.\n\nLiara's belief that power from a malevolent source can still be utilized for good is a principle shared by Shepard should he choose the control ending in Mass Effect 3. In that scenario, Shepard sacrifices his organic form to become the ruler of the Reapers, becoming a god-like entity that controls all Reapers in the galaxy. He makes the same decision Liara did by assuming control of the Reapers and acting as an unopposed god who has power no one else in the galaxy has. Shepard recognizes the value in the Reapers in the same way Liara valued the Broker's agents, saying this:\n\n>\"There is power in control. There is wisdom in harnessing the strengths of your enemy.\"\n\nThis \"power\" allows Shepard to control the Reapers into helping the galaxy rebuild after the Reaper war.\n\nBy controlling the Broker's intel in lieu of destroying it, Liara's decision asserts that absolute power doesn't corrupt absolutely, and when in the right hands, can do more good than harm.\n\n# Synthesis: Project Overlord\n\n[A visual representation of David Archer's synthesis with the Geth's VI](https://preview.redd.it/7bq33icew6rd1.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=146eb9cb080f0f057d589b94c7d2aa67405c0c5b)\n\nIn the Overload DLC, the fusion of David Archer and Geth technology mirrors the Calalyst's fusion of organic and synthetic matter in the Synthesis ending.\n\nThe objective of the DLC's eponymous Overload project is to fuse David Archer's mind with a VI interface. In doing so, this will allow Geth and mankind to communicate and understand each other in ways previously not possible. While Galvin Archer initially claims that it was David who volunteered to be fused with the Geth, David's outbursts to \"MAKE IT STOP\" make it abundantly clear he is forced into these experiments. Galvin later concedes that \"The Illusive Man doesn't broker failure,\" attempting to justify his unethical experiments on his brother.\n\nGalvin rationalizes his work into a mere equation. When pressed by Shepard about his experiments, he responds with this:\n\n>\"If my works spares a million mothers mourning the loss of a millions sons, my conscience will rest easy.\"\n\nGalvin contends that it is ethical to sacrifice the life of a single person if it will save a million more. This may sounds similar to the Trolley Problem, but there is a key distinction.\n\nThe Trolley Problem is a dilemma in which death is unavoidable- it is certain the train will run over somebody. The only decision, therefore, is whether it is ethical to minimize suffering by running over one person instead of five. In the Arrival DLC, it is a certainty that the Reapers are coming, and while thousands will die by hurling a meteor at the relay, there will be less suffering than if the Reapers were to invade and kill countless more.\n\nThe Overlord project lacks this certainty. Even without hindsight, there is no guarantee that Galvin's experiments will save lives. In addition, there are experiments that, while they may take more time or are less likely to yield immediate results, are undertaken with the consent of its test subjects. And with hindsight, it is clear that Galvin's words bear no fruit. In Mass Effect 3, if Shepard allows Galvin experiments to continue, David was able will be able to communicate with the Geth more and more. However, he'll eventually relapse into a vegetative state, prompting Galvin to euthanize his brother out of mercy. Galvin experiments demonstrate that  a supposedly \"necessary evil \" is still evil, and that his experiments on his brother are far from justified.\n\nOverload DLC also mirrors Synthesis in how it infringes on the rights of the people that Synthesis aims to protect. Just like David did not consent to being experimented on, the people of the Milky Way Galaxy did not consent to becoming organic-synthetic hybrids. Although not much conveyed in-game, it can be inferred that there are many anti-synthetic organics who would be opposed to altering their DNA to become synthetic hybrids. While others may argue that this infraction of aliens' right is for the 'greater good' of the galaxy, this is yet again the same justification Galvin used for his experiments on his brother. The only difference is that this is on an immensely larger scale, affecting not just one test subject, but trillions. Even if Synthesis comes with the promise of peace, the Synthesis ending is achieved by a single person deciding the fate of billions in the Milky Way Galaxy. It is unethical for Shepard to make that decision for them.\n\nWhile Project Overload is a failure, the project's vision can be realized in the Synthetic ending. Just like David was used as a conduit in Project Overload, Shepard sacrificed his body so that his organic matter could fuse with synthetic matter. Essentially, the Synthesis ending is what Dr.Archer hoped Project Overload would accomplish. The two major differences is firstly, that it is Shepard himself who decided to sacrifice his life for the Synthesis ending; and secondly, that the sacrifice of Shepard's body immediately produced results. After Shepard throws his body, an explosion emanates from the Crucible that reaches across the galaxy, almost instantaneously combining organic and synthetic matter. This fusion is what allows for the coexistence of synthetics and organics, altogether ending the conflict between the two ad infintium. Even the Star Child touts Synthesis as \"the ideal solution,\" stating that Shepard's Cycle is the first to truly be ready to integrate with synthetics. These are the ideal results that Galvin Archer sought to grasp, but failed to ever reach.\n\nIn spite of his efforts, Galvin Archer's unethical experimentations on his brother demonstrate that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and that synthesis between organics and synthetics is easily said than done.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5o1qmnurw6rd1.png?width=1742&format=png&auto=webp&s=f70758f0e8817494046e1d763b7aaf9216684ef4\n\nUltimately, there is no single, perfect solution to the Problem. in the Destroy Ending, it is unethical to commit the genocide of synthetics; it in the Control ending, is unethical to yield power to an unopposed, omnipotent ruler; and in the Synthesis ending, it is unethical to forcefully change the DNA of organics. Mass Effect 2's DLC are only a dip in the water when it comes to exploring the solutions and their many ramifications. Yet they are still the starting point when it comes to truly understanding the ending of Mass Effect 3.\n\nFor a series as great as *Mass Effect*, there is no truly 'good' ending. There is no war without casualties, no success without sacrifice. For every something gained, something is lost too, whether it be a loss of humanity, a loss of one's rights as a human being, or, perhaps most gravely, the loss of human life itself. Shepard's final decision in Mass Effect 3 shows the tremendous moral dilemmas that are repeatedly explored and executed throughout the trilogy.",

            "body": "Sorry this is a bit long.  All names changed.  Throw away account for all the reasons.\n\nWhen I was in college in the 90s, I met \u201cJake\u201d (then M23) through mutual friends.  He had already graduated and was planning to move to the opposite side of the United States for grad school and I had already been making plans to move with friends only a 90 minute drive away from where he was moving to.  We had so much in common, fell in love and it really seemed like fate, both planning to move 3000 miles and landing so close together.  He had two sisters and a younger brother who were all awesome people and I became instant friends with them as well.  \r  \n\r  \nBecause he was in school and I was working, I would usually go to him to hang out on weekends.  He was renting a house with 2 roommates, also in his program.  We were young so money was tight but we had fun, went for taco dates and spent a lot of time at his house where he was breeding and selling small animals.  Jake was an animal sciences PhD student so being around animals was normal and I loved it.  I met and became friends with his advisor\u2019s wife (\u201cMary, F mid-50s) who worked in administration at the university.  She is a lovely woman and I would often have lunch with her when I went over on weekends.  Jake was a teaching assistant (TA) and I met other people in the program and made friends with them faster than he did.  \r  \n\r  \nAfter about 2 years of dating, I was at the house one day, laying in bed together, in a state of some undress and he said out of the blue, he was concerned I\u2019d been gaining weight and it made it harder for him to be attracted to me.  No concern about my health, it was all about him finding me unattractive.  I sat up and said, well, then maybe you should make sure there is better food for me to eat than crackers and cheese when I come up on weekends.  Even at 23, I didn\u2019t take that kind of BS.  I had gained MAYBE 10 pounds since meeting him two years earlier and still wore the same size clothes (about a US size 6-8).  I wasn\u2019t going to engage in a fight about it after all, it was his problem, not mine, so I asked him calmly, so what is your solution to this?  He stared at me blankly and said well, I guess that you should try to lose weight and I said, nah, I\u2019m not going to do that so what are YOU going to do about it.  He said, well, I guess nothing, I wanted to let you know how I feel and I said, cool, thank you, put my clothes back on, went to sleep and drove home the next day as usual.  \r  \n\r  \nWe keep dating and about 3 months later he called me and said he wanted to break up after close to 3 years.  The reason AND I QUOTE \u201cYou don\u2019t know enough about science\u201d.  He felt like he couldn\u2019t have a conversation with me about his work where he didn\u2019t have to use common names for animals instead of scientific ones.  I said, well, that\u2019s bullshit, what\u2019s the real reason.  He said it was the real reason.  He came to see me a month later to return something of mine and I confronted him, demanding the real reason.  He finally admitted he had been seeing one of his undergrad students, let\u2019s call her Meg, a 19 year old.  He was then 26 and her teacher.  I screamed at him to leave, my roommate threated to throw him off our second floor balcony if he didn\u2019t go and he left.  It hit me all at once after he walked out and I went from rage to stunned laughter.  I\u2019d met Meg a few times and at one point, she was at his house for a BBQ and spilled something all over her pants.  Jake asked me if I could loan her some sweats.  I couldn\u2019t because I was a size 8 and she was a size 18.  Nothing wrong with that, AT ALL, but the point is, I realized he made those comments about my weight to try and get me to break up with HIM because he was a coward.  He clearly liked a big gal.  Although, when he\u2019d said those things to me about my weight it was 1am, I lived about 95 miles away and we had just had sex so I don\u2019t know how he thought this would go, even in hindsight, it\u2019s perplexes me.  \rDid he think I was going to break up with him and storm off into the night and drive for an hour and a half?    \n\r  \nANYWAY, I emailed his roommates, it was the early 2000s, it\u2019s how you communicated anything you didn\u2019t want to say on the phone. I wanted to let them know we'd broken up and that they were always lovely to me and thanked them for being friends.  They both admitted they knew about Meg and were the ones to demand that Jake tell me or they would.  That\u2019s when he broke up with me with the lame, you don\u2019t understand science excuse.  One of his roommate, a super nice, super cute guy named \u201cGeorge\u201d offered to help me get a few things still at their house that he had collected for me away from around the house.  He suggested I come up for the weekend, we go out and drink and have a good time, all the things Jake didn\u2019t want to \u201cwaste\u201d money on and I said sure!  \r  \n\r  \nSo I went up and George let me into the house while Jake was gone.  I took photos of all of his animals because while I might not be a PhD student, I paid attention and I knew he had an endangered species in his care.  He wasn\u2019t breeding it, it was an un-releasable animal he had taken in from a rescue organization.  There was paperwork he had to submit with a $25 fee and he refused to do it, saying he didn\u2019t want the government in his business.  I took photos of that animal, all his breeding conditions and a photo of an animal not allowed in the state which was in a tank, right next to a window and visible from outside.  I then went out for a night on the town with George.  We stumbled in early, around midnight so Jake and Meg who were watching TV would see me in a short dress, drunk and George practically carrying me.  I spent the night in George\u2019s room.  He was a total gentleman but made sure to leave the room and parade past them in his boxers a few times and we giggled and moaned loudly so they could hear us.  When I went to leave the next morning, Jake said I didn\u2019t have to act like a whore in front of him as I ate a donut slowly in my rumbled dress with messy hair while George beamed at me and then planted a kiss on my head.  Meg looked ashamed, not quite knowing where to look and I said have fun with my leftovers and walked out.  I wanted to think the petty, loud, \u201chook up\u201d and a few juvenile insults was my \u201crevenge\u201d.  It was not.  \r  \n\r  \nThe next day I had my photos developed (ahhh, the good old days) and called the state office of Fish and Wildlife.  I reported the animals in the house, the potential over-crowding of breeding animals and the two animals he shouldn\u2019t legally have at all in the state and asked them how to make a report.  Turns out Jake wasn\u2019t well liked by his peers in his program, or by his roommates but I was!  George had suggested that he and their other roommate could submit complaints to the University that a TA was sleeping with one of his students and showing her favoritism.  The night we were out at the bars, we made sure to tell the story to anyone who they knew.  They made sure all the women in his classes knew he was sleeping with Meg.  It wasn\u2019t a large program so people knew fast he had cheated and was now dating his student.  George and the other roommate made sure people knew they had put in complaints, sick of Jake\u2019s entitled BS.  \r  \n\r  \nWith my full statement made and photos sent to the state wildlife officials, I called my friend Mary, Jake\u2019s advisor\u2019s wife.  She knew about the break up and lame reason and I let her know he admitted he was sleeping with a student.  I\u2019d been emailing with him and he admitted to it in writing so I sent that to Mary.  To say she was not happy about that was an understatement.  She said she made sure it would be investigated and told her husband, Jake\u2019s direct advisor while I was on the phone with her.  \r  \n\r  \nSpeaking of investigations, a few weeks later George called me, giddy, to say state Fish and Wildlife officials were there, confiscating animals.  He told them he would be happy to tell them whatever they needed to know.  Meg was there when it happened and told the officials as far as she knew, all the animals belonged to her boyfriend Jake and that they were all legal.  That put George and the other roommate in the clear.  One animal was kept in the backyard so it was implied to Jake that a neighbor reported it.  While they were there to investigate, they knew to look in the back window to see the far more problematic, illegal to have in the state under nearly any circumstances, animal.  Since George was on the lease, he was able to let them in to investigate in the house.  The animals were all in communal areas and the officers stayed there for a few hours and returned with a warrant to take all the animals and enter Jake\u2019s room to investigate.  George and the other roommate let them into their rooms with no issues and were quickly cleared.  Meg apparently couldn\u2019t get a hold of Jake and eventually drove to the University to find him.  Remember, no cell phones yet!  It was a good day.  The only animals they left was some guppies in a fish tank.  \r  \n\r  \nNow, PhD students need grant money to do research and a large part of animal studies funding comes from the federal government.  Jake had just gotten an EPA grant right around when he broke up with me.  So I called the EPA and asked how I would report that a person with a federal grant was being investigated for illegally harboring endangered animals.  Long story short, he lost his EPA grant and had to make restitution on what had already been used, close to $30,000.  He would never be able to get another federal grant.  He avoided jail time on the state charges since all the animals were in good health but lost all his breeding animals (worth thousands of dollars) since they were collected for safe keeping during the investigation when the two illegal animals were taken.  In the end, he owed a $15,000 fine and the two animals went to a nearby nature center.  For years, I would stop by if I was in the area to visit them!  \r  \n\r  \nThe university revoked his scholarship and fired him from teaching for having an inappropriate relationship with a student.  He somehow escaped being expelled but it always shocked me that he never tried to hide the relationship with Meg and was so stupidly self assured he didn\u2019t even wait the 4 weeks until she would have been done with his class to start publicly dating her.  By the University rules, he would have been in the clear to date her, not being her teacher anymore and she would just have to avoid any classes he was a TA in.  It never fails to make me laugh.\r  \n\r  \nAfter a few months, I emailed his sisters and told them I missed them because Jake broke up with me after trying to call me fat and cheating on me and I felt weird contacting them.  The girls told me he told the family I broke up with him because of the distance.  I forwarded them emails that Jake wrote after the breakup, talking about how he fell for Meg and he was sorry about it but it was true, I couldn\u2019t keep up with him academically and it made him attracted to Meg.  \r  \n\r  \nJake managed to convince his dad to pay for one more year of school so he could get a Master\u2019s instead of a PhD and while I stayed in contact with his sisters and brother via email and then social media, I largely let it all go.  I got even, made some friends, Mary became like an auntie to me and I went on with life.  I went on to get a master\u2019s degree myself and my specialty?  Helping scientists and doctors communicate their work to lay people.  You know, us dummies who can\u2019t remember all the scientific names.  I swear, it happened by accident, not design but I love it and I work with everyone from small town doctors and nurses to pharmaceutical companies to museums to state and federal governments to film and TV producers.  I travel a lot and speak and get to learn a lot of cool things about our planet and how things work.  \r  \n\r  \nI knew through his siblings that Jake and Meg got married and had 2 kids.  Meg dropped out of the sciences and became an accountant, Jake went back to breeding animals.  Every once and awhile, his sisters or brother would tell me something over for lunch or via text but we had our own relationship that exists outside of him.  Apparently when I sent a wedding gift for one of his sisters he loudly complained at a co-ed bridal shower that all of his siblings still were my friend and didn\u2019t make an effort to embrace his now wife, Meg.  Apparently the sister just laughed and said, I don\u2019t make it a habit to be friends with homewreckers.  This is how Jake\u2019s parents found out how their relationship started and ours ended, 10 years after we broke up.  Jake never found out I was behind reporting him to the state and in the end, I didn\u2019t lie about a single thing, except maybe exaggerating a drunken make out session with George who is now a successful and tenured professor with a lovely wife and daughters.  \r  \n\r  \nFast forward about 20 years to a few weeks ago. I was at a university giving a lecture to a room of 250 undergrad and grad students.  In the end, I was mingling with the student afterwards and I hear a voice say, hey OP, long time no see and I realize it\u2019s Jake and I didn\u2019t change the expression on my face, at all.  I was completely shocked and my instinct was to play dumb!  So I said, I\u2019m sorry, help me out, have we met at another workshop or lecture?  He looked incredulous and said, it\u2019s me Jake and I said, I can\u2019t place you but I would love to figure it out.  Finally I gasped and said, oh my goodness, Jake!  I guess I blocked you out and said, well, lovely to see you and moved on quickly when he tried to reach out and hug me.  I was happy to leave it there, with the satisfaction of him seeing me as a guest lecturer in a science department of a major University when he was just in the audience.\r  \n\r  \nThe department chair and faculty who had invited me to speak took me out to dinner and while there, one of them said, so you know Jake?  I said, I did from over 20 years ago, being vague about how.  She went on to tell me he had been there for an interview for a teaching position and had spent a few days there observing and they were likely going to hire him.  I couldn\u2019t control it, I scoffed.  When they all looked at me I said, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m just shocked he\u2019s teaching after what happened at University X.  They said what happened and I said, he was sleeping with a 19 year old student when he was 26 and he had to leave the program without a PhD because he couldn\u2019t afford to stay after losing his scholarship.  The three people I was with all looked at each other like they knew they had a problem and said, wow, we\u2019ll have to look into that and changed the subject.  \r  \n\r  \nMy old friend Mary (retired a year or 2 now but still friendly with her old collages) called me this weekend to say a friend at the university let her know someone had called doing a background check about Jake and they pulled his file which included being fired, leaving the program with a lower degree and the complaint letters from over 20 years ago about his conduct.  Mary\u2019s name had been on it with her husband listed as the faculty advisor, so she thought she\u2019d like to know.  As a bonus, it had a copy of his arrest record for the illegal animals.  I guess his dad had paid for a decent lawyer to get the record expunged after the charges were reduced and he paid the fines so it doesn\u2019t show up on a standard background check.  I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to get that job.\r  \n\r  \nSo I will return to my life, content that the universe comes through sometimes, especially if you give it a little nudge now and then.  The best revenge is when you don\u2019t have to do anything wrong, you just have to help direct knowledge to the right places.  If there is anything I can impart to any young women and men reading this, as I shimmy happily into my now size 10 pants, it\u2019s that, if someone who is supposed to love you complains about your weight or looks, that is their problem to fix mentally, not yours and maybe it\u2019s time to check out what they are doing behind your back or simply move on.  Remember though, it is their flaw, not yours.  If Jake hadn\u2019t been a coward and tried to make me break up with him and just ended things with me in a mature way, I might not have found out about Meg and turned his own wickedness back on himself.  \r  \n",

Palestinians are almost definitely going to be the numerical majority in a one-state solution. \n\nThe only way a Jewish state can exist if Israel doesn't annex most of the West Bank or any of Gaza. If Israel annexes enough of the West Bank to make a Palestinian state non-viable, its only a matter of time until the rest of the West Bank has to be incorporated into Israel. If that happens, Gaza would also have to be annexed, since it is not viable on its own and no other state wants it.\n\nI literally just don't know where the two-state solution opposers wanna go from here. Even if Israel manages to keep Gaza out of the state, the Knesset would be practically 60/40. It would hardly be a Jewish state at that point. Rather, it would be a crappy binational state that would quickly balkanize.  Not to mention, some parts of the West Bank are hotbeds from terror. Setting up unrestricted travel from Jenin to Tel Aviv would cause a host of security threats. What exactly is the plan if the two-state solution becomes permanently abandoned?",

            "body": "Disclaimer: I am not writing this to provide a balanced \"both sides\" look at history because it would be too ambitious.  I am not attempting to justify the terrorism of Palestinian activists in any way. Instead, my goal is to explain why the Israelis don't want a two state solution based on history many people are unfamiliar with.\n\nEuropeans have dominated North Africa and the Middle East for centuries. The Crusader states are remembered but people are ignorant of the more modern conflicts like the French-Algerian War. The French and the British were massacring Arabs long before the nationalist and religious movements of the 19th century in Europe and elsewhere. The Ottomans were also considered a foreign occupier by the Arabs which is why the Arabs sided with the British in WW1.\n\nContext is critical. As far as the Arabs are concerned, Israel is just another in a long line of states established by foreign powers and imposed on the Arab population; no different than French Algeria. That's why they insist that their fight isn't with Jews; it's with Zionists.\n\nIn 1900, Jews made up less than 5% of the population of Palestine. Christians and Druze were more numerous. \"The Jewish population in Palestine increased from 56,000 in 1918 to **about 88,000 in 1922**, when the total population was officially estimated at 750,000. By 1939, the Jewish population had increased to 445,000 out of a total population of about 1.5 million.\" During this time, while Arabs and Jews were massacring each other, Zionist militias were smuggling arms into Palestine.\n\nDuring this time, there were both Arab and Jewish terrorist organizations who were attacking the British as well as each other. After the Second World War, the Zionist terrorist organizations murdered the UN peace envoy, blew up the King David Hotel killing 90 people and kidnapped, tortured and murdered British soldiers in retaliation for the execution of convicted Zionist terrorists.\n\nThe origins of the state of Israel have become mythologized with the events before May 14, 1948  ignored. There was a vote at the UN where every state in the Middle East voted against the creation of the state of Israel but was outvoted by the United States and it's allies (countries receiving aid from the United States after World War Two are called \"allies\" although they voted the way the US told them to). Although the British controlled Palestine, they didn't vote with the United States. They abstained.\n\nAll of the horrors of the October Hamas attack happened first in 1948 as the Zionist terrorists engaged in every sort of atrocity you've read about happening to the Israelis in October. Babies were beheaded. Women were raped to death. Hostages were taken and paraded before jeering crowds before being tortured and executed. The goal was to drive the Arabs out. In fact, the Zionist terrorist organizations engaged in Ethnic Cleansing. As a result of the attacks on the Arab population, the Arab countries invaded and the Israeli War of Independence began.\n\nWhen the United Nations proposed a two state solution, the Arabs felt that they shouldn't be expected to accept another \"Crusader state\" in their midst. But the Zionists immediately accepted the deal. As a result, the Zionist terrorist organizations became the Israeli military and the terrorist leaders became politicians. (Three Israeli Prime Ministers were former terrorists and all three were members of Likud - Netanyahu's party. The Israeli who assassinated the Prime Minster of Israel was also a member of Likud.) Since 1948, the Israelis have demanded that their neighbors accept Israel's right to exist and said the Palestinians should've taken the deal in 1948.\n\nThe Israelis do not want to give up their advantage of being a state by allowing the Palestinians to have  their own state. They don't want anybody to say \"Palestine has the right to exist.\" They know they can claim the moral high ground and are never going to give up that advantage. If Palestine becomes a state then terrorism becomes a police problem for both countries. That's the obvious solution but it's not what the Israelis want. Because then they would have to get serious about the settlements in the West Bank.",

I am a very strong believer in Isreal and I do not believe that a true two state solution is possible. As long as we give the Palestinians territory and we alow them to have their own government they will continue to attempt to exterminate us. The Jewish nation has been prosecuted over and over again and we never let that hold us back. When we give the Palestinians land and give them rights to have their own laws it creates a barrier. We need to be clear and straight up. We cannot allow this to go on any longer. The Muslims that consider themselves Israeli and are proud of Israel should and do have the same rights as every Israeli Jewish or not. \n\nI believe even Netanyahu and the right wing party is too liberal. They need to stop giving into the American and international pressure. They need to take more action and do it faster! I believe it need to be clear, we are not going anywhere. We will not negotiate with terrorists. If we put the emotions aside and take the actions that would be needed it would be a safer and happier country for both side. \n\nGiving Palestines their own land with their own rules is like a girl that keeps telling a guy \"I'm not interested\" while consistently biting her lip and flirting. In that cenirio that guy will be super confused. He's being let on while being told \"no\" and deep down is hoping that she will turn around and give him a shot. \n\nWe need to show the Palestinians that there is no shot for a 2 state solution because in their eyes a 2 state solution means that there is a possibility of \"from the river to the sea\" Palestine will be the only state and Israel won't exist. \n\nIsreal will always be! We need the world to see the truth and stop getting manipulated by the fake news that points all the negative fingers at Israel \n\nIsrael is the only free democracy in the middle east\nIsreal has the largest gay community in the middle east (if not the only one)\nIsrael is a country that believes in peace \nIsrael will do anything for their citizens (doesn't matter what race or religion) \n\nIn \"Palestine\" \nGay s illegal (punishable by death)\nWoman hardly have rights\nBelieves that hunting down Jews is from the best things a man can do \n\nI have a friend who was raised Muslim. He only found out at age 18 that his mother is Jewish. He said it was the most confusing thing to learn because he grew up with a hatred, he grew up learning that one day they will exterminate all the Jews in Isreal. He didn't learn hate they way me and you know hate he learned that he is supposed to cause the jews in Isreal to suffer. \n\nWhile my school was super liberal teaching us that we can live together and that there should be a two state solution. We learned that most Arabs are good and some are sick and we shouldn't be so quick to judge. It's unfortunate that alot of Israel shares that way of thinking when all the Palestinians want to see is us in pain.\n\nOnce my friend learned he was Jewish he got curious, long story short he ran away from home. Little secret, he's petrified that if his father would find him today (10 years later) he would kill him, he believes that his father would actually kill his own son. Why does he believe that? It's very simples because it's true, his father and his community believes that every Jew living in Isreal should be killed and the harder it is to kill the person the more reward. \n\nI don't know anyone that would kill their own son even if they switched sides and became pro Palestinian (unless obviously if they are a terrorist and they want blood, I assume most people I know would defend themselves) \n\n\nI used to live in Jerusalem, right next to an Arab village, no one I know would ever enter that village BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T COME OUT ALIVE. Even the police do go there. While those \"Palestinians \" drive in and out of my community daily (I won't mention all the issues they cause) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We know this is not an actual choice.\n\nAnd the only realistic way for \"human rights\" is for is a Two State solution. One where Palestinians govern themselves and accepts that they no longer have the rights to the parts that are now Israel. It's also a solution that protesters and Palestinians vehemently oppose due to the new nation essentially being a dependent of Israel, and Israelis also opposing because, well, they'd have a newly created dependent state.\n\nSo what is an actual course of action for Isreal and Palestinians to take? It feels like the only way to satisfy the protestors is to literally have the entire region become a Muslim majority government, essentially having the Israelis leave or worse. There is no One State solution that doesn't eventually have one group marginalized.\n\nEveryone knows that will never happen.\n\nSo what are the *realistic* things Pro-Palestine people want?\n\nI admit I'm not an impartial viewer. Israel shares far more values in common with me than the other side, but watching this conflict play out is also tearing out my heart. But every time I feel like the casualties are swaying me to call for unilateral peace, Hamas does some shit that reminds me that is impossible.",

I don't think it is necessarily a win for either player, I just haven't seen any evidence that has convinced me it's a draw. Sorry in advance for the long post.\n\n# About Me\n\nI guess I'll start with a bit of my background. I have two degrees in pure mathematics: a bachelor's and a master's. I am currently in the process of getting my PhD. While my research is not in game theory, I have taken several classes on the topic and think I am rather knowledgeable on the subject. I also enjoy playing chess in my free time, however, I am by no means a master at all (\\~1500 chess.com). I am no expert in chess or game theory, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. I'm more than open to having my mind changed.\n\n# Why people think chess is a draw\n\nFrom what I can tell, most people seem to agree that chess, if played perfectly, is a draw. It seems to me that the main argument is that as player strength, or engine strength, increases, so does the draw rate. The natural conclusion is that extending this to perfect play, chess should be a draw. I am not aware of any other arguments, but if others exist feel free to let me know.\n\n[Elo rating vs draw rate](https://preview.redd.it/ywwinvkyldrd1.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=d78c5e1891768fd66fa04d090da10cfa0bf8fd96)\n\n[(source)](https://unclejerry9466728.wordpress.com/2018/12/20/172/)\n\nI have two main problems with this argument. The first is how far we need to extrapolate to arrive at the conclusion, and the second is the lack of combinatorial evidence.\n\n# Perfect play in chess\n\nLet's take a step back and talk about what perfect play in chess would look like. In order to play \"perfect chess\" you need to have the game fully solved. A solution would look like an assignment of a valid move to every possible state arising from the strategy. You don't need to have a move for every position in chess, only the ones that could arise from playing your strategy.\n\nNow, how big would such a solution be? There are an estimated 3.8 x 10^(45)\u00a0possible board states in chess\u00a0[(source)](https://tromp.github.io/chess/chess.html). I'm not too sure how many of these would be possible for a given strategy, so let's just plug in the arbitrary 0.00001%. This gives us 3.8 x 10^(38). Assuming you need 1 Byte to store one position and the move, the storage it would take just to store the solution would be equivalent to storing the entire internet about 5,937,500,000,000,000 times. I think it is safe to say we are very far away from such a solution.\n\nWhile we aren't close to storing a solution, that is also not how chess engines work. So the question remains, are engines close to perfect play? I would say we are nowhere close. While it isn't feasible to have engines store complete solutions, they do work in a similar way, they just start from the current position and try to build the game tree from there as far as possible, evaluating certain lines further. So, unless a theoretical solution is some relatively short line with an obvious winning/drawing position at the end, I don't think these engines would be able to get anywhere close to finding it. I would imagine (again, with very little evidence) that a theoretical win in chess would more likely look like some depth 50+ (maybe even 100+) depth game tree, where it is not obviously winning until near the end, and I do not think it is feasible that our current engines would be able to find that.\n\nIn my opinion, extrapolating current draw rates to perfect play is just too far of an extrapolation. It is like observing that white wins more often at 600 level play than 200 level play, and concluding that at GM level play it must be a sure win for white.\n\n# Should the trend even continue?\n\nAs humans, we love seeing and extrapolating trends. From trying to beat the stock market day-trading, to people trying to beat roulette with weird strategies, to people being superstitious because something bad happened the last two times they saw a black cat. We are very good at finding patterns, but very bad at evaluating if there is something causing them, or if they are just random. My second point is that I do not see any combinatorial reason to believe such a trend in chess should even continue. You can think of an example where there is one winning strategy, and any deviation from said strategy leads to a (comparatively) easy draw. You would expect the draw rate to increase as engines got stronger until an engine got strong enough to evaluate the entire winning strategy, in which case it would then win 100%. Obviously, this is an extreme example, but any number of less extreme examples could result in a similar reversal in draw rates. What evidence is there to suggest that this is less likely than the trend continuing? I think this is best illustrated with an example.\n\n# An example with nim\n\nNim is one of the first games you learn about in combinatorial game theory. It is a two-player game and starts with a certain number of \"heaps\" of objects, with each heap having any number in it. For example, you might have four heaps of sizes 9, 10, 4, and 6. On each player's turn, they take any number away from any one heap. The game ends with the loser taking the last object remaining (more information\u00a0[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim)). It is known that for games starting in unbalanced positions, it is a theoretical win for player one. Again, a strategy is a choice of a move for every possible position. We can train a bot to play nim as follows: we first assign to it a random strategy. It then plays against itself starting from each position according to its strategy. If it wins from moving into a given position, it evaluates that position to be winning and updates its strategy to move into that position whenever possible. Otherwise, it evaluates it to be losing. We can repeat this process iteratively, and think of this as increasing the strength of our bots. You can also prove quite easily with induction that this eventually leads to perfect play. On each iteration, we can make the bot play against itself and keep track of the wins and losses. In the following figure, I trained the bots from a random strategy to a perfect one 10,000 times. In between each iteration, each bot would play itself 10 times and keep track of the wins and losses. So after this was complete, on each iteration number, we have 100,000 games played between 10,000 different versions of the same \"strength\". The starting state was the aforementioned 9, 10, 4, 6 game. Here are the results:\n\n[Strength \\(iteration #\\) vs win &#37;](https://preview.redd.it/6jrzyvi0mdrd1.png?width=966&format=png&auto=webp&s=859c0141f3f058746acc1be605d42b918464d864)\n\nAs you can see, we see a sharp decline in player 1 win rate starting at about iteration 15. If you were to extrapolate this trend, you would view it as clear evidence that the game is winning for player 2. But, this immediately is reversed once perfect play is achieved (iterations 25-27 depending on the simulation). If this is happening with such a simple game as nim, it could certainly also happen for more complex games like chess.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI am not sure if chess is a draw or a theoretical win, but I do not believe it is clear either way. I think bots are way too far from perfect play to extrapolate anything, and I also do not see any combinatorial evidence to suggest such trends should continue.

            "body": "I am appalled at what I see teachers put through. I usually back teachers, then my kids, then admins because of what I have experienced. This last year I had to literally stand in front of a door and tell 4 administrators that no one was leaving until my child's classes were changed because of the bullying and ignored violence. This was after 2 years of trying to address the issues through their process. After which my child went from failing grades to all A/Bs. I have tried so hard to make this place better. I have donated money, computers, tablets, and volunteered time. At this point I'm done with this school. This year I had to call the board and tell them that if they did not publicly inform all of the parents about a situation  with a gun at school, that I was going to do it for them the next day by showing up at the school with parents protesting and a news crew. In this case there was an active multi-day case that they did not even inform the police because Virginia law doesn't require them to do so.\n\nSo here is what I want to understand. ~~Why don't teachers unite together, stand the fuck up for yourselves and handle this situation? I understand the risk of not having a job~~,(see edit 2 for the strikethrough reason) and the risk of students not being taught, but how far is this going to go?\n\nTeachers have become student and parent punching bags. Not to mention how admins treat them or how counties under fund them. The only reason my kids are still in this system is because of a messy divorce. I think it is time you all stop taking the shit.\n\nHow does this all get fixed?\n\nEdit: I want to clarify. I don't believe teachers are at fault here. Some people read it that way. No one is closer to the situation than teachers though. I believe that if anyone knows what needs to be done best, it is going to be the teachers. I have learned so many things from the comments.\n\nEdit #2: I did not understand the totality of risk of \"standing the fuck up for yourselves\". For me, If I get fired for standing up for myself I will happily go somewhere else because I don't want that anyway. I honestly didn't realize this was not a widely available option. So what does it take to put the power of education with educators so you can happily stand the fuck up for yourself without being in fear of homelessness, joblessness, and retaliation when you have the need. This is absolutely insane and I am so sorry for what has happened. \n\nA lot of problems with every solution so far but it is looking more like it is on parents to get this going if it is to get better. \n\nFor those of you that have not been reading hours of comments. here is my summary so far. \n\n* Teachers are not allowed to to teach our children the way they taught us. This is because teachers have been stripped of authority. \n* Teachers in many states cannot strike or protest due to legal, financial and societal repercussions. This is because it would cause controversy in a politically controlled aspect in our lives, education. and that is just not good for the politicians. \n* Parents have widely slacked off on being involved, backing and supporting teachers and staying in our lane when we should. This I can't understand because these children are literally the only ones who will give two shits about you when you are old and need help. so, it is in your best interest to make sure they do well and are well educated. so, if you dont care enough about your kids at least be selfish so you get taken care of. \n* our nations divided politics have caused side effects that are actually causing teachers to have to avoid teaching the truths to our children in fear of severe repercussions \n* We have somehow voted in horrible unsupportive leaders in our state and federal run education system that use education as a platform to get: rich, popular, lazy, etc. and continue to vote these asshats back in because we are not paying attention to what is happening.\n\ndid I miss anything?",

            "body": "Yesterday Bibi made the statement that he rejects Biden's efforts to unilaterally impose a two state. While that sounds like a good advice, I think it is a mistake to reject America's overtures here.\n\nLet me preface this with the fact that I am a right winger typically, and I like this proposal because it allows most Israelies not to be kicked out of their homes, and I think it's a better option securitywise.\n\nAlso editing in another preface :) That accpeting this plan wouldn't mean that Israel needs to ceasefire or not wipe out Hamas in Gaza. We can accept a future American plan for 2 state borders, without stopping the war that gets us to these borders.\n\nThere are basically three issues at play with why Israelis consider rejecting this proposal a good idea.1- It requires unilateral disengagement2- It can become a security risk for Israel to have Palestinian independent statehood on the border of our capitol and only a few dozen kilometers from Tel Aviv. It could turn into Gaza 2.03- It rewards the Palestinians for Oct 7\n\nSo, I'm going to go through each one of these drawbacks and share why I don't think they are relevant here:\n\n1- What the Biden administration is proposing is not a radical full disengagement from the West Bank. From what I've read, they are proposing a two state similar to the borders of the Trump Plan, which Israel already accepted a few years back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xuynou453wic1.png?width=342&format=png&auto=webp&s=794f4e20e10eae89515efc3c72c4a9aa3140b205\n\nThis means minimal need for Israeli disengagement of settlements. The real change on the ground would be less internal checkpoints and Palestinian civil control in more areas. When Trump proposed this, the Palestinians rejected it offhand. Now, it seems Biden wants to unilaterally impose it on the Palestinians, giving them no choice on whether to accept. If we say no to this deal, we won't have a deal on the ground at all, and in the future, politicians will try to impose more radical solutions that require more West Bank withdrawal. Whereas, if we accept it, even if it falls apart in a year or two due to Palestinian radicalization, it becomes the new \"facts on the ground\" and starting point for negotiations of a state.\n\n2- From what I've read about the plan, there are a few pieces in place to prevent it from becoming Gaza. Firstly, Biden plans to reform the PA, which probably means hire some strongman goon to take over the control of PA. Honestly, the Abbas regime is pretty weak, and the West Bank is rapidly devolving. A reformed PA could improve Israeli security. In addition, the proposed state is supposed to be demilitarized, and I don't think there will be any clauses to prevent Israeli raids in case of military need (like they are doing already in Jenin and other West Bank places every night). The security situation on the ground wouldn't be worsened, because Israel could still take the unilateral steps it already does to take out militant cells, and, if anything, it would be improved if the reformed PA works.\n\n3- It \"rewards Palestinians for Oct 7.\" honestly, my impression of this is that it's more of an emotional, rather than practical, response to Palestinian pseudo-statehood coming on the heels of a war. The Biden solution makes practical sense, and it's probably the best deal Israel is going to be able to get in the near future, since right now the Palestinian political faction is weak and not able to refuse America's \"offer.\"Honestly, it's not uncommon in history, for a big war to precipitate a unilateral Great Power imposed solution. The example I like to cite is the Greek-Turkish wars of the 19th and 20th century, which have actually a ton in common with Israel-Palestine (Modern Greece began as a diaspora liberation movement, both Greece and Turkey claimed much of each other's lands, the conflict went on for about a century, and then after a war that devasted the region, and had mass killings of civilians on both sides, the Great Powers imposed a solution, and since then, there has been zero fighting in the region, outside of flair ups in Cyprus...\n\nThe point is sometimes a unilateral solution, can be not a rewards for massacres, but rather the massacres can make it possible for both sides to accept a solution they wouldn't otherwise accept. Whether Palestine sees it as a \"reward\" or not is really irrelevant, because if we don't accept it, there is no pseudo solution, and status quo remains and in status quo there's a high likelihood of Palestinians trying to repeat an Oct 7, and Israel needs to be constantly on guard. Whereas, if we change the status quo, there's a chance it could work out peacefully, and a chance that we'd need to be constantly on guard anyways.\n\nEditing to add that as far as Palestinians declaring vicotry for Oct 7 also, Egypt is convinced they won the Yom Kippur war (even though they lost land and were within an inch of losing a massive part of their army before Kissinger forced a ceasefire). But they don't try to Yom Kippur us again, we have now a cold peace, evne though they think they won the Sinai at gunpoint.\n\nEditing to add, I forget to include benefits of the plan which are:\n\n\\-it isolates Iran by helping Israle normalize with neighbors and strengthening US control in West Bank while weakening Iranian militia\n\n\\-it gives Biden a win, so depending on your views on the 2024 election it could be a plus or a minus.\n\n\\-it is low risk for israel but has a slight possiblity for peace (not high but higher than status quo)\n\n\\-it creates a paradigm shift on the borders of a two state and makes future destruction of settlements less likely\n\n\\-it probably results in a friendly PA\n\n\\-it strengthens Israel/US ties",

Political Zionism views the West Bank (Judea and Samaria) as an integral part of the historic and religious Jewish homeland. It holds deep historical and spiritual significance as the heartland of ancient Israel and the birthplace of Jewish civilization. The idea of an Israeli government, particularly one with strong Zionist convictions, agreeing to evacuate Jewish communities from the West Bank and transferring control to the Palestinians \u2013 modern-day \"Amaleks\" is ideologically implausible. As is the idea that settlers will accept Palestinians ruling over them. It is a betrayal of the core principles of this form of Zionism. I also don't see all the Christian Zionists and Evangelicals, who massively outnumber the Jewish Zionists, getting on board with it, either. And arguably, their support is needed to get meaningful US action on the matter. The two-state solution isn't there to solve the problem but to buy time so a Jewish state \"between the Sea and the Jordan\" can be created.\n\n*\"The right of the Jewish people to the land of Israel is eternal and indisputable\u2026 therefore, Judea and Samaria will not be handed to any foreign administration; between the Sea and the Jordan there will only be Israeli sovereignty\".* \u2014\u00a0Likud Party Platform, 1977.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI'm still waiting for anyone in this thread to present an ideological argument, let alone a convincing one, for Zionists to renounce the Jewish claim to the West Bank\u2014especially considering that the return to the Land of the Torah is a central theme in Jewish prayers, traditions, and identity.

            "body": "Just to preface: I'm an Israeli, I fully believe that a two state solution is the only way for peace and that eventually Israel will have to withdraw from the west bank.\n\nLast month the UN general assembly passed a resolution calling for the complete withdrawal of Israel from the occupied territories in 12 months, among other things. This is obviously completely impossible for 2 main reasons -\n\n1. Currently there are around 700K Israelis living in the west bank and transfering all of them out of there in a year is simply not doable. It's not like Israel has cities, houses and jobs ready to accommodate these people. The toll such a massive transfer of civilians would take on the economy and probably military is just too high for such a move to be realistic.\n\n2. Israel cannot withdraw from the west bank before it is stable enough to not be threat to Israeli security. Pulling the army out of the west bank would leave Israel's heartland completely exposed to attacks from militants within the territory, something Israel simply can't allow to happen as it would majorly compromise the country's security. This is obviously the main reason why such a hasty, one sided withdrawal is impossible. \n\nThis makes this resolution, in my opinion, detrimental to peace and not the opposite. \n\nThis is because it's a resolution that Israel simply cannot accept. The consequences of this will be that many around the world and in Palestine will have the idea that Israel continuously ignores UN resolutions reinforced and Israel will garner even more hate for it. And in Israel it feeds straight into the \"UN and everyone is anti - semitic and can't be trusted\" narrative, which only strengths and emboldens the nationalists and drives people away from peace. \nI also thinks this leads the the UN becoming less credible as what's it's point if it is pushing out unrealistic resolutions? \n\nIn my opinion if the UN truely cared about achieving peace they would adopt a resolution calling for Israel and the PA to restart earnest talks about adopting a 2 state solution, and the fact they instead adopted this one shows their interest isn't peace, but rather virtue signaling and optics. \n\nNow I know some might say that the UN general assembly resolutions are non binding and it's more about sending a message and reinforcing international law, but I would still say that sending an unrealistic message is useless and causes more harm than good.

I\u2019ve been keeping track of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for quite a long time, and I have some knowledge of the history of the State of Israel, mainly about the conflicts fought by the country since its establishment. When I heard the news about October 7, I was appalled by the atrocities committed by Hamas and the other jihadist groups, and I was even more appalled when the world\u2019s opinion immediately switched back to the usual \u201cFree Palestine\u201d rubbish as soon as Israel moved to defend itself. I\u2019ve always supported Israel, it\u2019s right to exist, its people, and I think Hamas is just a tiny Taliban that deserves whatever the IDF does to it.\n\nI\u2019ve seen a number of different arguments released by pro-Palestinians as reasons for their opposition to Israel, from their claims of genocide against Palestinians, to claiming that this is the worst urban destruction in modern times (Bucha and Mariupol would like to have some words about what those two claims really look like), to pretending like they didn\u2019t go silent or even celebrate when innocents died or got taken from their homes on October 7. I think their ignorance is abhorrent and that they should jump off the bandwagon before it rolls off a cliff.\n\nOne argument that I have consistently found, however, that particularly confuses me is the claims of Israeli apartheid in the West Bank, which they back up with references to things like Area C (a West Bank region accessible only to Israelis, if I remember correctly) and the fact that certain roads can only be used by Israeli traffic. I\u2019d like to do some more research about it to see if it has any sort of evidence other than some slogan-chanting students on TikTok (tbh I doubt it), but first I\u2019d appreciate an opinion from Israel itself. What do you guys think of these accusations and the things that they use as evidence for their claims?\n\nHave a good day or night \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7",

The national party the  enacted their extreme segregation of races, removal of Africans from their homes, banning of mixed race marriages and relationships, established bantustans etc which lead to international condemnation and sections, insurgency/terrorist campaigns by the anc and other African groups, and the South Africa we are struggling today. \n\nBut what if the UP was able to win? Part of the issue was how the rural pro NP areas were over represented. If the UP wins i can\u2019t see that happening, plus the UP wanted more European immigration while the NP only wanted Dutch immigrants, and the UP also wanted coulred (mixed) peoples and Asian/indians to be more equal iirc. With more white Immigrants who won\u2019t be NP friendly and with the coulred and Indian vote they will likely be able to stay in power long enough that apartheid never comes about since that window to enact it would be closed by the late 60s. \n\nNo apartheid, no sanctions, gradual racial integration, a larger white population and likely more mixed and Asian/indian population too, probably no flight of the white community like we see iotl, and no anc government running the nation into the ground like we see today. What do you guys think? What do you think the modern South Africa would be like with such a divergence point?  ",

            "body": "Ah, the good old \u201cIsrael is apartheid\u201d argument\u2014like clockwork, it reappears every time someone needs an easy moral high ground without doing any of the actual intellectual heavy lifting. Let\u2019s get real for a second: the West Bank isn\u2019t apartheid. Not even close. And if you want to argue that it is, you either need a refresher on what apartheid actually was or you\u2019ve been reading too many social media hot takes. So, buckle up, because I\u2019m about to explain why the West Bank doesn\u2019t fit the apartheid label\u2014using real, actual legal principles, and not whatever buzzwords happen to be trending.\n\nLet\u2019s get one thing straight: apartheid was a system in South Africa where a white minority brutally controlled a black majority, stripping them of basic rights, enforcing racial separation in every part of life, and making sure the balance of power was always tilted in their favor [\\[1\\]](https://www.britannica.com/question/What-is-apartheid). Now, compare that to what\u2019s happening in the West Bank. Oh wait\u2014you can\u2019t, because the situation in the West Bank is literally the opposite of that. As legal scholar **Eugene Kontorovich** (someone who actually knows a thing or two about international law) has pointed out, the West Bank is under military occupation, not some racial regime designed to keep one ethnic group forever on top [\\[2\\]](https://www.econtalk.org/is-israel-occupying-the-west-bank-with-eugene-kontorovich/#audio-highlights). Let\u2019s break that down, since apparently people can\u2019t grasp the difference. Under international law, military occupations happen [\\[3\\]](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/hague-conv-ii-1899/regulations-art-42). They\u2019re a normal, albeit unfortunate, part of conflict resolution when territory is disputed, and they\u2019re legally recognized under the Fourth Geneva Convention [\\[4\\]](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.33_GC-IV-EN.pdf). Is it ideal? No. But it\u2019s not apartheid, either. Kontorovich has pointed out that the military occupation of the West Bank follows the rules laid out in international law\u2014rules that don\u2019t apply when you\u2019re talking about apartheid, which was a crime against humanity designed to enforce racial superiority [\\[5\\]](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/apartheid). Do you see the difference? Because it\u2019s pretty stark.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the kicker: the Palestinians aren\u2019t even citizens of Israel [\\[6\\]](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-know-about-arab-citizens-israel). They\u2019re residents of a disputed territory, and their leadership has consistently refused to come to the table to negotiate a peace settlement that could give them statehood [\\[7\\]](https://www.camera.org/article/palestinians-rejected-statehood-three-times-claim-frustration-with-israel/). Kontorovich has explained this time and time again: Israel is under no legal obligation to extend citizenship or civil law to a population that is not part of its state [\\[8\\]](https://jcpa.org/why-israeli-rule-in-the-west-bank-is-legal-under-international-law/). This isn\u2019t South Africa, where the apartheid regime kept millions of black people under its thumb while denying them the right to vote or have mostly any say in government [\\[9\\]](https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/history-elections-south-africa). In the West Bank, the Palestinians have their own government\u2014the Palestinian Authority [\\[10\\]](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Palestinian-Authority)\u2014and the reason they don\u2019t have a state yet is because of political deadlock, not racial domination [\\[11\\]](https://www.hoover.org/research/why-there-no-palestinian-state). So, no, Israel isn\u2019t running an apartheid system where Jews lord over Palestinians in some dystopian race-based hierarchy. The Palestinians have their own leadership\u2014and if they don\u2019t like it, maybe they should take that up with the PA.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the \u201csettlers,\u201d because people love to throw that word around like it\u2019s proof of something nefarious. Yes, there are Jewish settlers in the West Bank, and guess what? They live under Israeli law because\u2014wait for it\u2014they\u2019re Israeli citizens. Kontorovich has repeatedly pointed out that this isn\u2019t some grand injustice; it\u2019s the basic functioning of legal jurisdictions. Palestinians aren\u2019t subject to Israeli civil law because they\u2019re not Israeli citizens. That\u2019s not apartheid, that\u2019s just how military occupation works [\\[12\\]](https://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/96375/frontmatter/9780521896375_frontmatter.pdf). It\u2019s no different from the way Western Sahara [\\[13\\]](https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/04/01/morocco-tainted-trial-sahrawi-civilians) or northern Cyprus [\\[14\\]](https://www.state.gov/reports/2022-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/cyprus/area-administered-by-turkish-cypriots/) are governed under occupation, and yet, somehow, those situations never get slapped with the apartheid label.\n\nAnd here\u2019s another fun fact: Israel has tried to negotiate peace deals multiple times\u2014you know, those moments when they offer to give back the majority of the West Bank for the creation of a Palestinian state [\\[15\\]](https://www.britannica.com/event/Peel-Commission) [\\[16\\]](https://www.britannica.com/topic/United-Nations-Resolution-181) [\\[17\\]](https://www.britannica.com/event/Camp-David-Accords) [\\[18\\]](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Oslo-Accords) [\\[19\\]](https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/asia-and-africa/middle-eastern-history/camp-david-accords) [\\[20\\]](https://ecf.org.il/issues/issue/214). But every time, the Palestinians have said no, because apparently, peace isn\u2019t as sexy as international sympathy [\\[21\\]](https://www.memri.org/tv/hamas-spokesman-encourages-gazans-serve-human-shields-its-been-proven-effective). Kontorovich has written extensively on how Israel has gone above and beyond what international law requires to try and end the occupation through diplomacy (source). But what are they supposed to do when their negotiating partner refuses to budge? Just pack up and leave the West Bank and let Hamas move in, turning it into Gaza 2.0 [\\[22\\]](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-jun-15-fg-gaza15-story.html)? Sorry, not gonna happen.\n\nAnd speaking of Gaza\u2014let\u2019s take a little field trip down memory lane. In 2005, Israel withdrew from Gaza [\\[23\\]](https://www.britannica.com/event/Israels-disengagement-from-Gaza). Pulled out every soldier, every settler, handed the keys over to the Palestinians. And what did they get in return? Rockets, terror tunnels, and endless calls for their destruction [\\[24\\]](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/shadow-of-israels-pullout-from-gaza-hangs-heavy-10-years-on-idUSKCN0QF1QQ/). So, forgive Israel for not jumping at the chance to make the same mistake twice in the West Bank. This isn\u2019t apartheid\u2014it\u2019s the harsh reality of trying to keep your citizens alive when the other side keeps rejecting peace [\\[25\\]](https://jcpa.org/defensible-borders-for-israel-an-updated-response-to-advocates-and-skeptics/).\n\nLet's wrap this up: what\u2019s happening in the West Bank isn\u2019t apartheid but rather a military occupation that\u2019s been going on for years, and as **Kontorovich** has pointed out, it falls within the boundaries of international law [\\[26\\]](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2835908). Israel isn\u2019t targeting Palestinians because of their race or ethnicity\u2014it\u2019s dealing with a territory stuck in political limbo for decades [\\[27\\]](https://unispal.un.org/pdfs/9614F8FC82DCA5DF852575D80069E0C0.pdf). The idea that Israel is running some racist regime is not only factually wrong, it\u2019s intellectually dishonest. If you want to talk apartheid, go study South Africa [\\[28\\]](https://www.britannica.com/place/South-Africa/History). If you want to understand the West Bank, stop throwing around slogans and start looking at the legal facts.",

About 70% of them **don't have a Lebanese citizenship**. That means they don't get basic human rights like freedom of movement, health care and education. They also can't own land or work in 20% of the jobs.\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, Palestinian refugees in Lebanon live in \"appalling social and economic conditions.\"\nThis absulotely can't go on this way. \"People will always yearn for freedom and resist apartheid regimes\". The poor Palestinians in Lebanon **don't get a citizenship, so they can't even be classified as second class citizens**.\nThey don't get Lebanese identity card or registered as regular citizens so to not skew the fragile demographics of Lebanon.\n\nDon't lot me get started on Jordan.\nThere are about 6 million Palestinians in Jordan, at least 750,000 of them **don't have Jordanian or any citizenship**. They are treated awfully, can't vote to parliament, work for the country or even buy property. This is disgusting. \nSo many basic human civil rights are being taken from those Palestinians in Jordan, only in the name of keeping the Hashemite kingdom safe.\n\nThe world has failed the poor Palestinians. We see them suffer such primitive discrimination in countries that suppose to give them shelter and full rights, yet the UN and the entire West just looks at them being stripped off their rights for years on end.\n\nI can go on about the violent Islamic regime that the Palestinians in Gaza are subject to, or the corrupt Palestinian Authority that only ever benefits Mahmoud Abbas's pockets.\n\n**I wish more countries could be like Israel, where the Palestinians get full human rights and the chance to prosper in the land they're in.**\nThis is truly a miserable situation for the Palestinians. I hope the apartheid regime they're under could be lifted and they could be a regular citizens of the free world. They can no longer be stateless in a land they inhabit for generations.\n\nSources:\n\n- [Palestinians of Lebanon: Generations of refugees denied integration and basic rights](https://reliefweb.int/report/lebanon/palestinians-lebanon-generations-refugees-denied-integration-and-basic-rights) (Relief Web)\n- [Palestinians cannot own businesses in Lebanon and are banned from most decent-paying professions, including medicine and law.

Even the existence of the film itself, which debuted at the Venice Film Festival, has the effect of legitimizing the filmmaker's own long list of crimes in violation of Ukrainian law.\n\n**This reputation laundering propaganda was co-produced by Canadian taxpayers: $340,000 of the film's budget was provided by an organization that receives public funding.**\n\n*Trofimova's statements during the press coverage of the film:*\n\n>\"They start to fight because they lost someone. And it's maybe a question of revenge.\"\n\n>\"I didn\u2019t go there with prejudgement.  Of course, I had all these stereotypes in my head that I got from reading Russian and Western media.  But I didn\u2019t judge.\"\n\n**A soldier in the film openly denies the accusations that russian troops are committing war crimes.  Trofimova says that she \"did not see any such crimes.\"**\n\n>\"I think in Western media, that's what Russian soldiers are associated with at this point, because there were no other stories.  This is another story.  This is my attempt to see through the fog of war and to see people for people.\"\n\n*Coverage:*\n\n* [\"Do the Russians cry too?\" Russia Today propagandist's film screened at the Venice Film Festival](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/09/6/7473743/)\n* [Film Schedule at the Toronto International Film Festival (screening Tuesday)](https://www.tiff.net/films?schedule)\n* [Documentary \u2018humanizing\u2019 Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine sparks outrage at Venice, Toronto film festivals](https://kyivindependent.com/documentary-humanizing-russian-soldiers-fighting-in-ukraine-sparks-outrage-at-venice-film-festival/)\n* [Ukrainian Canadian Congress: Why is Canadian taxpayer money being used to fund Russian propaganda?](https://www.ucc.ca/2024/09/06/why-is-canadian-taxpayer-money-being-used-to-fund-russian-propaganda/)\n* [Canadian organization excuses their funding of the russian propaganda film in naive statement that film was not approved by russian state](https://www.ucc.ca/2024/09/07/ucc-responds-to-tvo-statement-on-russian-propaganda-film/)\n\n*A screening is scheduled for Tuesday, 9/10 at the Toronto International Film Festival.*",

It seems the events of the Nakba, where Palestinians were displaced from their homes in 1948 by Israeli settlers, is an important part of why Palestinians continue to resist what they believe to be the occupation of their homeland. \n\nSince this is a main reason for the conflict, what are some reasons Palestinians aren't allowed allowed to the right of return to Israel? Related questions would be, what does the right of return look like? Does it involve giving the land back? Monetary reparations? Letting Palestinians immigrate to Israel? Trying to hear and understand all the different reasons.\n\nI am also wondering what rationalizations both sides have on the possibility of a one-state vs two-state solution. I've read that a one-state solution where Palestinians in the West Bank or Gaza are reintegrated into a single multi-ethnic, Muti-faith state with Israel is largely untenable. What are the reasons for that? ",

I\u2019m curious to hear what this sub thinks about the right of return and Ezra\u2019s discussion on that matter.\n\nDuring the episode, Ezra gives his opinion on the Right of Return, echoing the position of his [former coworker Matt Yglesias](https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1736359358018011452):\n\n>**EZRA:** I think \u201cRight of Return\u201d is a lie that has been told to people. And that is the part of it that kind of breaks my heart. I have talked to people who have worked in refugee camps in Jordan, Egypt etcetera and they\u2019ve met people who have keys to their grandparent\u2019s house on a necklace around their neck, because it shows that you\u2019re going to go back there someday. And you\u2019re not. That is not how these conflicts have ever worked. I think the idea that international law tells you it will work that way, is a lie international law is telling you.  \n>  \n>There is no right of return for the Jews who were expelled from Iran, there\u2019s no right of return for the people expelled during Partition in India and Pakistan, no right of return for the Germans expelled after WWII out of Eastern Europe \u2026 about 900,000 Jews is the number I\u2019ve heard were expelled or left or fled different parts of the Middle East during this period \u2014 there\u2019s no right of return for them. It\u2019s not going to happen \\[\u2026\\]  \n>  \n>\\[Israel\\] is a state that is for the people it has defined itself as being for, which is true for most states. I think saying it\u2019s a Jewish state and that\u2019s so weird \u2026 I think America is a state for Americans, China is a state for the Chinese, Brazil a state for Brazilians. States are imagined communities \u2014 nationalities are imagined \\[\u2026\\] it\u2019s not so unusual for countries to decide who it is for, and then if you are not in that definition you don\u2019t get to come there and have citizenship. Mexicans cannot just come to America and say, well, I live here now I\u2019m a citizen. For that matter neither can Canadians.  \n>  \n>And I think if you look at Israel as just a normal state that is going to try to act as many other states would in this scenario, a lot of things just become clearer. Israel is a state, it\u2019s going to try to defend itself and maintain its own internal sense of cohesion. Most states would not be open to immigration policies that made their current majorities minorities overnight.\n\nDoes this discussion strike anyone else as \u2026 out of character? That it lacks the nuance and liberalism that is characteristic of Klein\u2019s thinking? Partially, this can be attributed to Ezra\u2019s recent interview guests like Tareq Baconi, who were unable to answer his questions about the right of return satisfactorily \u2014 though perhaps this was because Baconi is an academic historian narrowly focused on the history of Hamas, and a Palestinian commentator more versed in political punditry and international law would\u2019ve been a better candidate to field an answer on this subject.\n\nWhat I mean by \u201clack of nuance\u201d is that the \u201cright of return,\u201d as characterized by Ezra, is simply a question of immigration \u2014 but that is not true as I understand it. For one, \u201cthe right of return\u201d is partially interpreted to mean Arab Israelis \u2014 many of whom are the descendants of internally displaced Palestinians left inside Israel\u2019s borders after the conclusion of the \u201848 war \u2014 have their confiscated land returned or compensated in some manner. Some Arab Israelis [observe a yearly march](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-arabs-mark-palestinian-catastrophe-of-1948-in-annual-march) to the site of their former villages, a few of which remain standing but are completely unoccupied, to petition the Israeli government to allow them the rights to their empty homes.\n\nAs for the realism of this demand, Israel in fact already has a law on the books dedicated to the return of property \u2014 the 1950 Absentee Law, which is the exact law used to restore the century-old property rights of Jewish Israelis in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood after their expulsion in 1948, leading to the \u201cPalestinian families forced out by the IDF from their homes\u201d headlines you might have seen. However, this law was worded in such a way that while Jewish Israelis can file a claim on Palestinian land, whether in Israel or in the Occupied Territories, Arab Israelis can never do the same. In this case, the \u201cright of return\u201d is simply a demand for fair treatment under Israeli law.\n\nThere are other dimensions of the \u201cright of return\u201d beyond immigration. There is also the issue of reparations or compensation for the Nakba, something that has been floating in Palestinian circles as Israel refuses to budge on the right of return. Hamas, for example, included language in its 2017 charter that declared \u201cCompensation to the Palestinian refugees for the harm they have suffered as a consequence of banishing them and occupying their land is an absolute right that goes hand in hand with their right to return.\u201d\n\nWhile Hamas isn\u2019t giving up the right of return for compensation yet, that does demonstrate the extent the reparations idea has gained popularity among Palestinians, and opens up a potential avenue for negotiation and compromise beyond the question of immigration.\n\nI also mention the odd lack of liberalism in Ezra\u2019s argument here \u2014 I don\u2019t believe, though I may be wrong in this, that Ezra would accept the consequences of his argument when applied outside the Israel/Palestine conflict. For example, what to make of Reagan\u2019s famous amnesty for 3 million undocumented immigrants from Mexico in 1986, that set America on a completely different demographic course and permanently altered the ethnic composition of some American states such as California? How can that be reconciled with Ezra\u2019s claim that \u201cMexicans cannot just come to America\u201d?\n\nI don\u2019t think Ezra would accept, to choose another American example, the Cherokee Nation\u2019s decision in 2007 to strip the Black descendants of slaves owned by Cherokees from membership just because doing otherwise would dilute the power of \u201cthe people it has defined itself as being for\u201d (this decision was overturned in 2011.) Or the similar case when the Nooksack Indian Tribe expelled 300 members who had mixed Filipino-Native descent in 2012 \u2014 can we not support their right to return just because the self-fashioning of the tribe at that moment turned against them? Would that be tantamount to lying to them?\n\nThere is a dimension of time that seems to be missing from Ezra\u2019s idea of nationalism: America\u2019s conception of \u201cwho it is for\u201d has changed a lot from the Manifest Destiny era to the Progressive Era to the Civil Rights Era. Even Zionism had its shifts from Autonomous Zionism to Labor Zionism to neo-Zionism, from Albert Einstein\u2019s vision of a binational state with a Jewish minority to Ben Gurion\u2019s guarantee of equal rights contingent on a Jewish majority to the 2018 Basic Law that reserved the right of \u201cself-determination\u201d exclusively to the Jewish people. Is the self-fashioning of a nation really stable enough for us to generalize it into a larger judgment on the right of return?\n\nAnyways, the point I\u2019m getting at is that there are a lot of gradations between \u201cright of return\u201d and \u201cno right of return.\u201d So: what do you all think of the right of return personally, as it has appeared throughout this \u201cseason,\u201d as well as in Ezra\u2019s wrap-up discussion? What is your take?",

            "body": "Palestinians have been promised by their leaders that the resistance will not stop until the right of return for all refugees is granted. This is a cornerstone of their negotiating position. Never mind the fact that Palestinians are the only group in history where the refugee label includes all descendants, which makes the right of return a non-starter from the Israeli perspective. A 35-year old American doctor, born and raised in California, is considered a refugee if his Palestinian grandparent was one. No other refugee group is granted this broadening definition.\n\nThe belief in a full right of return was behind the Palestinians rejecting peace offers in 2000 and 2008. \n\nThe Israeli offer in 2000 tried to address the right of return with this offer:\n\n\"In the Israeli proposal, a maximum of 100,000 refugees would be allowed to return to Israel on the basis of humanitarian considerations or family reunification. All other people classified as Palestinian refugees would be settled in their present place of inhabitance, the Palestinian state, or third-party countries. Israel would help fund their resettlement and absorption. An international fund of $30 billion would be set up, which Israel would help contribute to, along with other countries, that would register claims for compensation of property lost by Palestinian refugees and make payments within the limits of its resources\"\n\nIt was rejected.\n\nThe other day I saw video of palestinian teenagers holding decades-old keys to houses/apartments that no longer even exist, proclaiming that 'these are the keys of our grandparents, and we will return!\"\n\nThe longer the Palestinian people are duped into thinking a full right of return is possible, the longer we'll go without a Palestinian state.\n\nThroughout history, those who lose wars (especially wars they start) must make compromises to start anew and move forward. Unfortunately for the Palestinian side, they refuse to make necessary compromises for a state to actually come to be. Eventually, people need to move on from the past and deal with present-day realities. Is the focus going to be nation-building or the impractical idea that millions of Palestinians will return to Israel proper?",

I can conceive of a few scenarios, but am really not certain.\n\n1) Perhaps the concern is that Israel would be overwhelmed in terms of sheer number of citizens and it would eventually compromise Israeli security?\n\n2) Was there a concern that Palestine would be granted unencumbered citizenship for those who truly did not deserve it under the pretense of \u201creturn\u201d and that this would add instability and security concerns to the region?\n\n3) Out of fear that it implied some sort of admission that Palestinians were expelled from the region.\n\n4) As a negotiation tactic, wherein this could be given as a big concession further down the line of the peace talks.\n\n5) Maybe I\u2019m misunderstanding the remarks.

            "body": "Arguably even more than the establishment of a Palestinian state, the biggest roadblock towards the end of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the \"Right to Return\". About 5M Palestinians, who claim to have relations to the land of Israel are requested to be allowed to resettle in that land.\n\nIsrael has long rejected said right for a few reasons: Losing the Jewish majority (rendering Israel as a de-facto not-Jewish state), civil wars, offering compensations of 30B$ instead and allowing only a small amount of Palestinians to resettle, the claim that many Palestinians left because hostile Arab countries told them to before the 1948 war (which means said hostile states should accept them as citizens instead) etc... However, that doesn't change the fact there are plenty of Palestinians who act as refugees in other countries and want to come back to their home.\n\nBut let's pretend Israel agrees to the \"Right to Return\". What than? When there's an Arab majority, it is very likely Israel will become not much different than how the land was during the Ottoman Empire era. During said era, the Arabs suppressed Jews and Christians to be 2nd class citizens. Those who claim that Jews and Arabs lived well together once and if Israel agrees to the \"Right to Return\" than Arabs won't be hostile towards them, are either lying or are unknowledgeable about history. Jews activists and their supporters were massacred quite often. That not \"lived well together\". Israel can't turn into another Lebanon.\n\nThe Jewish state was specifically established to be a place for Jews to avoid worldwide anti-Semitism. Allowing said anti-Semitism into the very state that's supposed to be clean from it will result in Judaism being more fragile than ever. There's only 1 Jewish state in the world. Only 1 tiny state where Jews should feel safe to be who they are. Why force Israelis to agree to something that'll threaten their very existence?\n\nAnd on the subject of \"Right to Return\", if Israel is to allow Palestinians to return to the land, than Israelis who once lived in other countries and were banished to Israel should be allowed to return to their land if they want to. Admittedly, 2 wrongs don't make a right. But I say: \"YOU FIRST\"! If the world wants Israel to allow the Right to Return, the world has to show it's willing to undo its crimes too and allow expelled Jews to return as well. Maybe, if and when a \"Right to Return\" deal is made, other countries should join in (including Lebanon and Iran) and allow Israelis with relations to certain states to gain immediate citizenship. It has to happen all at once. Israel won't allow such a right without other countries doing the same.",

            "body": "So about 20 days ago I bought my first metal detector and tried it out in my backyard. After some time I got a strong signal from the detector and dug up a gold ring. It was quite deep underground. About 10 or 12 inches (20-25 cm) I\u2019d guess.\nAt first I wasn\u2019t even sure if it was real gold so I went to the jeweler to get it checked out and it turned out that it was indeed real gold. It also had the two letters \u201eKM\u201c ingraved. At first I thought those were initials from the person who made the ring, but i was wrong as they told me.\n I figured that the ring was probably lost a long time ago since it was buried so deep underground. My idea was that my landlords wife could have lost the ring when they used to live here 13 years ago. I tried to call my landlord several times but they didn\u2019t answer right away because they had been on vacation. After 20 long days of waiting for them to return, they finally called me today and I asked them to come over.\nWe had some coffee and I told them about my new hobby: metaldetecting.\nI asked if they had lost jewelery in their yard when they used to live here and my landlords wife immediately said yes. She lost her gold wedding ring when she was pregnant with their first child 18 years ago and were in the process of moving into a bigger home. \n\n18 fucking years man. I handed her the ring and she could not believe her eyes. She was incredibly thankful and happy. She never thought she would see it again. And \u201eKM\u201c are her own initials.\nTo see their surprised faces and how happy the ring made them absolutely made my day. It was awesome!\n\nTl;dr\nDug up wedding ring and was able to return it to the owner. Happy end for everyone.",

Realistically, moving back over 5 million palestinian refugees would not be possible given the size of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. There simply wouldn't be enough land available for 5 million more people, I mean Israel's entire population at the time was 7 million.\n\nThere were attempts to overcome this such as proposals to allow refugees the right to return in Israel proper but the palestinians requested 150,000 every year. Israel is right to be concerned that demographically this would lead to the state changing from a jewish state to a multinational state.\n\nI acknowledge the counter arguments regarding justice but a right of return would mean the end of Israel and palestinians know this. It's not worth giving up on peace because of this. I mean look at the current crisis which could have been wholly avoided especially in Gaza.\n\nI know that the incompetent and corrupt PA leaders were also one of the main reasons talks failed.",

You guys said \"Theyre going to screw you\" but I didn't believe you. Welp, you were right.\n\nGuide me.\n\nThe TLDR / Timeline is as follows:\n\nI (yes stupidly, we covered that) bought a laptop in July '24. From a third party seller.\n\nBy Late August '24 it was crashing regularly. I worked through support with Asus, and it was determined it needed to be RMA'd.\n\nI called Amazon, and pleaded my case. I run a small business, this is my only PC. Please just let me return it because I can't be without a laptop for a month during RMA. They agreed. The Refund was approved in early September, shipping label sent to me with instructions.\n\nI sent the Laptop back as instructed and waited. 10 days go by after they received it and signed for it, no refund. I call.\n\n\"Sorry, the seller has to approve the refund. Call the seller\". I call the seller. \"Sorry, Amazon has to confirm our Safe-T ticket, because it was returned past 30 days.\" I call Amazon. \"Sorry, the seller doesn't get to delay for that. Don't call the seller again, let Amazon handle it. Give us 5-7 days.\"\n\nI wait. 10 Days. I call Amazon \"Sorry, the seller is being non-responsive. Amazon will issue the refund ourselves and work it out with the seller later. 5-7 more days. Really.\"\n\n7 days go by. I call. \"Sorry, it's over $1000 so we need a special approval. Trust us. 5-7 days.\"\n\n**Any sane person would have charged back by now.** But we like Amazon. It's always been convenient. They're a huge company. They'll do what's right. We live pretty rural and they deliver so fast.\n\nDay 8 - I open an online chat with them (per your guys suggestion). The rep is great, promises a refund as soon as a supervisor gets back to her. 3-5 days.\n\nDay 5, Another chat. The rep: \"Wow this is insane, I'm issuing a refund right now and sending an E-mail confirmation.\" I got the confirmation. The amount and all, going to show up in my account in 5-7 days.\n\nWell, it's day 10 now. Today. I open a chat. I tell them the money needs to land in my account today. They escalate me to a supervisor. I tell him the same. I get escalated again.\n\nThe message i get next?\n\n\"It's been 90 days since purchase. Refunds are not possible. This concession is denied. Is there anything else I can do for you today?\"\n\nExcuse me, what?\n\n\"Sorry sir, nothing we can do\"\n\nYou have my computer. You have my $3000. I have e-mail confirmation of you saying it's on its way.\n\n\"Sorry sir, nothing we can do. Can I help you with something else?\"\n\n**Ok guys.** We can talk about me being stupid. We did it before. But what I really need is advice. I'm out $3000 AND a laptop. I called my bank (It's a business banking account) and filed a fraud claim and charge back. That's going to take a few days to process.\n\nChargebacks usually cant be done past 90 days, but I have so much proof of effort to work with Amazon they said they think it can be an exception.\n\nWhat else can I do to really be a PITA to Amazon at this point? Can I open a police report for theft? Should I call the BBB? Should I get my attorney involved? \n\n  \nOr just wait for the bank? \n\n\nEDIT:\n\nchargeback is in progress\n\nComplaint is filed at AG office\n\nE-mailed Jeff and Andy @ Amazon but it's been 24 hours no answer.\n\nEDIT 2: jeff@amazon got back to me. His name is Parul now. He promised me a refund in 5 - 7 days. \n\nI sent him a a copy of that same promise from 11 days ago and asked what that one meant.\n\nI'll continue with chargeback and AG claim.\n\n\nEDIT 3: \n\nAfter I Replied to Parul with a boatload of documentation...\n\nRefund hit my account 5 minutes later.

I adore my nieces and nephew, and I've always been the go-to babysitter whenever Emily needed help. I've taken them in overnight, watched them on weekends, and even took care of them for a week when Emily and her husband went on vacation.\n\nA few weeks ago, Emily called me in a panic, saying she had lost her wedding ring. She asked if I had seen it, and I genuinely hadn't. I helped her search the entire house, but we couldn\u2019t find it. Emily was really upset, but we eventually gave up.\n\nA few days later, Emily called me again, this time in tears, accusing me of stealing her ring. She said she couldn't think of anyone else who would have taken it since I'm the only person who's been in the house alone. I was shocked and hurt that she would accuse me of something like that. I tried to convince her that I would never do such a thing, but she wouldn't listen. She even threatened to call the police if I didn't return it.\n\nI couldn't believe my own sister would think so little of me. My parents got involved and took Emily's side, saying that it was suspicious that the ring disappeared right after I had been there. They pressured me to \"confess\" and return the ring, but I stood my ground because I was innocent.\n\nIn the midst of this family drama, Emily asked me to babysit her kids for a few hours because she had an emergency at work. I refused, telling her that I couldn't help someone who thought I was a thief. She called me selfish and said I was punishing her kids for something they had nothing to do with.\n\nMy parents are now furious with me, saying that family should stick together no matter what and that I'm being petty and immature. They believe I should just let it go for the sake of the children. Emily has continued to insist that I took the ring, and my refusal to babysit has only made things worse.\n\nEmily, her husband and my parents are calling me an AH for refusing to babysit and taking it out on kids who have noting to do with this.\n\nAITA for refusing to babysit my sister's kids after she accused me of stealing?",

On the way home he had spilled his milk shake and felt *very strongly* that this was somehow our fault and returned to demand recompense for this slight. To clarify. He bought the milkshake, was handed it to him, he drove 20 minutes down the road, spilled it in his car, then drove 20 minutes back to scream at us about it.  \n\n\"SOMEBODY IS GOING TO PAY FOR MY CAR TO GET DETAILED GOD DAMNIT\" he screamed. \n\n\"Well, sir, seeing as it is YOUR car and YOU spilled the milkshake in it, that is going to be YOUR problem\" \n\nHe insisted this was somehow our fault, and we owed him money. \n\nBy this point my manager had arrived and told him,\n\"Well, sir, we don't have any money to give you, your vehicle and what you do to it isn't exactly our responsibility. However we would be more than happy to give you another free milkshake.\" \n\n\"WELL YOU GOT A CASH REGISTER RIGHT THERE DON'T YOU?\" \n\n...\n\n\"You're aware that would be *robbery* right?\" \n\n\"WELL, I AINT MOVING UNTIL I GET MY FUCKIN MONEY! ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS, RIGHT GODDAMNED **NOW**!\"\n\nHe then proceeded to do exactly that, so we called the cops. Once they arrived he attempted to scream at them and started a physical altercation, he ended up being arrested. His vehicle was towed and impounded. \n\nIdk what his charges were exactly. The cops didn't tell us obviously, probably just for the disturbance he created, but yeah, lol. I once witnessed a boomer escalate a spilled milk shake into jail time. ",

The management team at the Tiffany store was deeply apologetic for their error and the time it took to get the bracelet back. \n\n\n\n\ud83c\udf89 I GOT THE BRACELET BACK!!! \ud83c\udf89\n\nI\u2019m so relieved and thankful to get it back\u2026.its been a heck of a day! Thanks to all who have followed along today \ud83d\ude01\n\n1st time here - honestly don't know what to do...I took my favourite piece of jewelry - a Tiffany bracelet that my husband gave me for my 40th birthday - to the store in my area on Friday to be cleaned. It was itemized on my ticket, I was told that I had to bring the claim ticket they gave me when I came back Monday) to pick it up, that the claim ticket had to match theirs...yada, yada, yada.\n\nI go back to the store yesterday, hand the person my claim ticket, she is gone a few minutes, comes back and says they can't find it. What? She says they are looking, but it's not where it's supposed to be....uh, ok...\n\nSo I wait...15 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes....I'm sitting in the service area at the back of the store and can hear all sorts of rustling around in the back room....nothing. Finally a someone comes out and introduces himself as a manager, he says that they can't find the bracelet, they are still looking and are also going to look at their video footage. My heart literally sank....I told him right from the start, someone's walked off with it.\n\nI sat in the store, trying not to cry, for another 90 minutes while they were looking....after all of that, the manager comes back and tells me what he 'thinks' happened....that my bracelet was given to another customer who was picking up a cleaning order. He said that he's called the customer,  that she is going to 'check if she has it' and call him right back to make arrangements to bring it back to the store.\n\nSo, I was left hoping that someone who clearly took home something that didn't belong to them - and likely knew it - would do the right thing and return it. Shock of shocks...the customer did not return the manager's calls or texts last night and I don't know what's going to happen.\n\nThey clearly didn't go through the process of matching claim tickets and clearly let someone walk out of their store with something that didn't belong to them. The bracelet can't even be replaced - Tiffany has stopped making it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bgsdduonix8d1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc810d9fa14ee3904d39ee2d311f06c94e43c9eb\n\n",

Image here: [https://imgur.com/a/DiW8uz8](https://imgur.com/a/DiW8uz8)\n\nHi Everyone. I'm very disheartened to share this news as a longtime and loyal Intel customer. I've purchased roughly $20,000 worth of merchandise with them over my lifetime and I've never once had to open any RMA requests until now. Unfortunately, it's very clear they are not standing behind their products and I'm going to provide to ton of detail and pictures below on what happened involving TWO retail boxed 14900Ks, one purchased from Amazon on 10/16/2023 (this was the release date of the 14900K for anyone not in the know) which was shipped from and sold by\u00a0[Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/), and one from Microcenter (brand new, not open box or anything like that, grabbed right off the shelf) on 02/11/2024, both experiencing the wide-spread instability issues.\n\nIntel has claimed that both products are \"re-marked\" and not genuine. The problem is that they definitely are not re-marked. They also tried to claim that one of them was a tray processor and thereby not subject to retail warranty, which they backtracked on, and then went the route of claiming it was re-marked.\n\nFull disclosure: Intel provided me with letters stating that the CPUs are not genuine and asked me to return them to their respective stores for a solution. I've done this and both stores, despite being WAY outside of return windows, DID refund me. Amazon gave me a full refund to my original payment method, and Microcenter gave me a full refund in store credit. In the end this worked out better for me, but that's beside the point. Now these two companies are having to shoulder the cost and burden of Intel's failure to take responsibility, and that's not right.\n\nThat being said, I'll be providing uncensored pictures of the retail boxes and CPUs which will show the full batch numbers and the full serial numbers. Since these CPUs are not in my possession anymore, and are ultimately going back to Intel, I feel it's fine to share them in their totality.\n\nHere's the details:\n\nThe processor purchased from Microcenter on 02/11/2024, partial serial 02096:\n\nI filled out the RMA form. Intel got back to me the next day admitting that the CPU was faulty. They then asked me for my shipping details and proof of purchase. I provided it. They then asked for pictures of the IHS. I provided it. Another day passes and they get back to me stating that the CPU is not genuine and is re-marked. WHAT!? This is news to me. This was purchased from a reputable retailer directly off the shelf. It was not open box, the seal was completely intact, and there was absolutely nothing suspicious about it. Furthermore, it showed correctly in CPU-Z as a 14900K and frequencies checked out, boosting to 6GHz single core and 5.7GHz all-core. I conveyed all of this information to Intel, and provided additional pictures of the IHS and the serial number just in case the previous pictures were too blurry. I also provided a picture of the retail box, clearly showing the full serial number and batch number, which did match the CPU. I also plugged in the batch number and serial number into Intel's warranty checker tool and it came back as valid with warranty until 2027. I took a screenshot of that and provided it as well. You can see all of those images in the image link below. They got back to me and said that their response hasn't changed and that they cannot divulge their investigation process. They insisted I return it to Microcenter with a letter they provided that it was not genuine. I did so, and Microcenter took a look. They said there was absolutely no evidence of tampering. The only thing they thought it might be was that there was some thermal paste still on the side of the CPU, and they said it made it look like it could have been delidded (however they confirmed it was NOT delidded). They suggested reporting their findings to Intel, and wiping away the paste and taking new pictures. I then reported those finding to Intel, to which they repeated that they cannot divulge the investigation process and they said that new pictures would not change their findings. It was at this point they told me I could continue with getting an RMA, but that if the chip was found to be re-marked they\u00a0**WILL**\u00a0retain and confiscate it. The exact verbiage was, \"We do not disclose our investigation practices. If you believe your products are valid and wish to proceed with a return merchandise authorization (RMA), we can create one.\u00a0**However, if the products fail the validation process, the units will be retained and confiscated, and no replacements or refunds will be provided.**\u00a0For this reason, we are giving you the option to take the letter and share it with the place of purchase. This will give you more possibilities to get a replacement since you have the processors in your possession.\" So, as you can see, they insisted I return it to Microcenter, so I did, and they graciously allowed me to return it for store credit.\n\nHere are all the relevant pictures for 02096, including Intel's letter claiming it is re-marked, original receipt, warranty checker from Intel, retail box, IHS, serial number close-up, a screenshot of the email where they threatened to confiscate the CPU, and a screenshot of their initial response via email:\u00a0[https://imgur.com/a/tC3AFFU](https://imgur.com/a/tC3AFFU)\n\nThe processor purchased from Amazon on 10/16/2023, partial serial 03252:\n\nJust like the last RMA, I filled out the form, they got back to me, said the CPU was indeed confirmed as faulty, asked for my information and pictures, I provided it all. They got back to me and quoted back the WRONG serial number (I provided the correct one in the original form and the picture CLEARLY shows 03252). They quoted that I was talking about 03262. They went on to explain that 03262 is a tray processor and not subject to retail warranty. They suggested that I take it back to the OEM. I got back to them and stated that they were talking about the wrong serial number. I clearly provided 03252. They got back to me and said that the image appeared to be a 6 instead of a 5. At this point I provided closer-up pictures of the serial number and IHS as well as a picture of the retail box showing the matching serial numbers and batch numbers. It was at this point they backtracked and said that 03252 was indeed a retail box. They said I can proceed with the RMA BUT that they were not confident that it would pass fraud validation. He then pointed out, and I quote: \"\n\nWe have reviewed the new photos you provided and will approve the return of the device marked \"03252.\"\n\n* **However,**\u00a0we are not fully convinced that it will pass the incoming fraud inspection at our depot. We strongly recommend that you return the product to your place of purchase.\n* Please familiarize yourself with the Processor Warranty Terms and Conditions, as well as the warning at the bottom of the warranty information page:\u00a0[Intel\u00a0Warranty Info](https://supporttickets.intel.com/s/warrantyinfo?language=en_US). Specifically, \"**Please be advised as part of Intel's ongoing efforts to prevent fraud in the marketplace, in the event the product you submit for warranty support is found to be re-marked or otherwise fraudulent product, Intel reserves the rights to retain the product and/or destroy such product as appropriate**.\"\n\n\"\n\nAt least this time they said they reserve the right to retain or destroy it instead of saying they WILL. At this point I contacted Amazon to let them know what was going on. I can't stress how good Amazon is. They didn't even ask for any extra details or screenshots, they simply allowed me to return the CPU for a full refund to the original payment method despite being 9 months outside of the return window. Kudos to Amazon!\n\nHere are all the relevant images for 03252:\u00a0[https://imgur.com/a/fInP3bC](https://imgur.com/a/fInP3bC)\n\nAt the end of the day, it felt like Intel was grasping at straws. They pounced at the opportunity to claim that one of the CPUs was a tray product, citing a serial number that was never even provided. Then when that didn't pan out, they pivoted to claiming it was re-marked. When I pressed them, giving several pieces of evidence for why each one was indeed valid, they stated I could continue with the RMA process but then turned to threatening me with confiscation or destruction of my property if it didn't meet whatever their validation process (that they won't disclose) is. The odds of both of these being re-marked or not genuine seem extremely low. It's definitely a scare tactic. And even knowing this, it worked on me! This feels like extortion, scamming, you name it.\n\nAnyway, I wanted to get all this out there. Everyone should know what they are doing!",

            "body": "So I do taxes. A client came in who usually brings his stuff in super early. But he came in right before the deadline. I was like man why are you so late? He then told me the saddest story about watching his wife die earlier this year. It absolutely killed me. Then he told me that he has stage 4 cancer and the treatment makes him so sick. So when his wife died he gave up on his treatment.           \nAs soon as he left I went in my office and put my head down and wept.               \nThere was like 100 people \"in line\" before his return to be done. But I was so moved I went ahead and did his. I know if he passes and owes money (which he does) he wouldn't want to burden his kids with it. Plus man, that was the saddest shit I've ever heard.            \nSo yesterday (3 days since he came in) and just in the nick of time for deadline, I finished his return and called him to come in and sign the forms.           \nHe came in today. And when he saw his return he was like \"whoa why do I owe so much. Biden was supposed to fix this, but he lied again lol\".                          \nI had to bite my tongue. I can't talk politics on the job. I I'm was just like \"and sign here as well\" just totally ignored him.                   \nLike, did he forget that Trump raised middle class taxes? Bro you voted for this.         \nThen before he left I said \"I hope to see you next year\" and he was like \"probably not. But it's ok I can't live in biden's America\".               \nAnd that's how I went from compassionate to indifferent in the span of about 6 minutes.              \n                     \nETA: since so many people don't think I know how to do my job, the guy had more interest and dividends this year and didn't pay any voluntarily federal taxes on his social security. Oh and he bought and sold stock with sizable wash sales. He was also given estimates last year that he didn't pay. Oh and I didn't even mention his comment about \"obummercare\".               \nListen. I'm at my wit's end with boomers but especially maga boomers. Most older clients who come in to pay us ask if I even know what a check is and ask if I can read cursive (I'm 40. Of course I do) But then the maga ones sneak in a cheeky lil racist comment or 5. Especially about the immigrants' rights advocacy center next door to my office. You wouldn't believe how causally they say this shit too. Like \"oh he's white so he must agree\". No, Gladys I Don't agree but you just paid us $1400 for your taxes and financial planning on your personal shit and are due for another $650 shortly for your rental property business quarterly reports. So yeah I keep my mouth shut.              \nHey, I might be an asshole cause I'm sick of boomer shit. Whatever. But you're extra an asshole for assuming so much about me when I told a story to vent and I kept it vague to protect client info and concise to get my point across.",

Sol saw a witch pushing Mae and Osha to the ground (remember, these are 8 year old girls) and noticed they were preparing for some sort of ceremony. He also saw them practicing dark magic. He was right to be concerned.\n\nThey approached the coven without hostility, and in return its leader attacked the padawan of the group through mind powers. This alone would be reason to attack, but they didn't.\n\nAfter that, when the Sol and Torbin return to the fortress, they are met with drawn bows. In spite of this, they do not draw weapons until one witch raises her weapon to attack. Then, the other witch, starts to do some crazy dark side stuff, and anticipating an attack Sol draws his light saber and kills her.\n\nThis action is what was supposed to be so horrible, even though it was clearly in self defense. \n\nThe ensuing battle, which was clearly started by the witches, did kill a lot of people.

            "body": "Start of October, I came home to 3 large boxes with the same last name addressed to my house. I called my mom to confirm whether we were expecting anything from overseas relatives. When she confirmed we weren't expecting anything, she called the number provided on the packages. They stated they didn't want it and to do whatever I wanted with it and provided no information. The 3 boxes contained misc items like jars of spices and lots of packaged clothes. I wasn't a fan of the clothes so after putting off the donation for 2 weeks, I dropped off the clothes at a donation box. Today, October 27, my mom called asking if I still had the contents of the boxes and my neighbor called her to say it was theirs and they wanted it back. I told her I either donated or tossed everything. During the evening at 9, I return to my house to see a group of 7 people crowding my yard. They demanded to know what happened to their package and that I essentially stole their stuff. If I wasn't expecting a package then I should've left it outside and I had no right to throw their stuff away. The situation was escalating and they were getting very aggressive. I showed them the shipping label that showed my address on the box but their only concern was I stole their stuff. They threatened to give me 1 day to return their stuff or they would pursue legal action. I had called the cop at this point as they were causing a ruckus and yelling. When the cops arrived they talked to us and our neighbor. That neighbor was accusing us of stealing the expensive jewelry in the boxes. The boxes had no such items and looked to be from a dropshipping company.\n\nIn any case, I'm starting to question whether I am at fault. Our neighbor confirmed the phone number on the boxes was hers but during the call, they said they wanted our address to pick up the stuff. Since they lied about the content of the boxes I have little reason to believe in what they say. In hindsight, I could've done other things but what's done is done. If this does happen again then I know what to do. I talked to friends after this happened and they said if they were in their shoes they would also be upset if someone donated their items. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: I realise now the wording is unclear. The last name on the boxes is the same as mine which is why I asked my mom if we were expecting anything from relatives. Thank you to everyone for informing me of the potential scam. I had no idea that was a common practice. ",

Mainly, they let them shit on any and every front lawn and don't bother picking it up. It's been a thing where I've made a point not to let my own dog poop on the front lawn, so I know if I find a pile out there - it wasn't my dog. \n\nIt's been such a problem that I've made a post about it here before. Well, it happened again. Doing some pruning in the front yard, I find two piles off to one side. I've been having some insomnia the last couple nights, so I know this is the perfect time to return the piles their dogs so generously left behind. At about 1am, I went outside with baggie in hand and instead of putting it in their garbage can like last time, I tossed those piles directly into the middle of their driveway - no bag, just poop. One kind of bounced and rolled under a car, but the other was a firm splat onto the pavement right next to the driver's side door of a different car. \n\nThis morning over coffee, I heard a disgruntled expletive and subsequent hose splashing. While I'm sure this won't stop the poops from coming, I think I've found my new favorite way to return their dog's shit. ",

The necklace wasn\u2019t expensive or really worth anything except sentimental value and we had wanted it to stay in the family (Jason and Laurie didn\u2019t have any children that the necklace would be passed down to). Nevertheless, Laurie refused to give it back. \n\nFast forward to a few weeks ago. I get a message on social media from Laurie asking to meet. She comes over to my house, and explains that she\u2019s had a very hard time since Jason\u2019s death and now is in a significant amount of debt (which they were even when he was alive). She then says she would be willing to sell my great grandmother\u2019s necklace to me\u2026for a thousand dollars. The necklace, if an appraiser ever had a look, would say it\u2019s worth about $150. I told Laurie she was out of her mind to come and attempt to extort money out of me with a piece of my family history (among other things that were not as child-friendly). Eventually she left.\n\nMy mom is pretty angry I didn\u2019t buy back the necklace. She says I should have at least tried to negotiate with Laurie and that standing on principle was stupid. My dad (the necklace came from his side of the family) agrees with me. The thing is, I made peace with not having the necklace. I have something to remember that particular piece of family history (a ring from the same jewellery set), and as shitty as I found it that Laurie wouldn\u2019t return it, it felt even more slimy that she held it to ransom all these years later. The thought of her profiting from what I consider a misdeed in the first place doesn\u2019t sit right with me. However, my aunts have now heard about it and are on my mom\u2019s side.

But Jon\u2019s point that we need to hold elected officials to higher standards, and that it\u2019s the candidate\u2019s job to convince us (the voter) of his or her electability is ringing truer than ever after that circus last night. \n\nIt\u2019d be funny if the fate of the country didn\u2019t hang in the balance.",

He raised his voice and was making a scene pissed that he couldn\u2019t vote. The election workers were very patient with him and explained that he had registered for a mail in ballot, and when they scanned his ID it showed up that he had a mail in ballot sent to him. \n\nThey explained either you return with your mail in ballot and return it to us, and void the mail in, and then you can cast your ballot in person. \n\nOr, vote via your mail in ballot, but you can\u2019t vote right now in person. \n\nHe was still angry and responded.  \u201cWhy can\u2019t I do both. Why can\u2019t I vote right now in person that I\u2019m here.\u201d They repeated the above again to him, and it finally settled and he stormed off. \n\nKudos to the election staff in handling this situation. \n",

From there, it chronicles the fallout. The memes follow kitty through the congressional hearing (A Few Good Men meme), show him watching the awards pile up on his last yolo post, him losing sight of himself. Then he returns to his original thesis (avocado-in-my-anus) and it steeled his resolve. He begins making memes, preparing.\n(The Shining, 500 Days of Summer). He feels hesitation about his impending return (Alice) and then has his moment of clarity (Matrix) and understands what he needs to do. Then we start seeing the plan take shape, he's waiting, watching for the signs that the time is right.\nAnd then all hell breaks loose.

There is ethnic cleansing in Sudan, the war in Ukraine, Gaza being devastated by bombings, and probably a dozen other brewing conflicts that I've missed. Not to mention the pressure being put on the Global South by climate change.\n\nYet in the Western World we seem to have largely hit our cap of immigrants. Anti-immigration sentiment and policies is becoming popular all throughout Europe, Canada and the US. Saudi Arabia straight up massacres crossing migrants, and countries like South Korea and Japan pretty much refuse to loosen their shell. \n\nIs there any plan or idea of what's going to happen if countries cease to accept refugees? How are we going to deal with this?",

I've only completed New Home and The Arks so far, and I can now do both on Hard Difficulty with ease. \n\nBut ever since I started Refugees 3 days ago, i haven't even come close to beating it. My record is day 19, just when you have to decide what to do with the lords, but hope is non-existent, discontent is high, and people are somehow starving with 2 hothouses that run from 6am-8pm (meanwhile I read somewhere that you can play this scenario with only 1 hothouse on Extreme? What!!!)   I am ALWAYS struggling for a resource whether it will be coal or wood or steel depending on the day, and I ALWAYS have to worry about temperature drops because I never manage to upgrade the generator in time, having to rely on Overdrive instead which doesn't even last for 24 hours. And how could I upgrade it in time when I need to research things like faster gathering, coal thumpers, beacon, steamhubs and steel works? \n\nI've read older threads with tips on this scenario and yet I still have no clue what the game expects me to do. It feels like this scenario only has 1 winning strategy with 0 room for error. \n\nI always start with child labor, followed by emergency shift, then soup and then overcrowding. I do the recommended tactic of working on 2 wood piles and 1 steel pile on day 1, building workshop during the night and applying emergency shift, turning on generator only during the night, building a cookhouse before the 1st refugees show up, building 2 medposts for the sick that are always heated... and yet somewhere along the line everything just starts to fall apart. People starving to death, medical outposts filled to the brim with sick, struggling to keep the generator running even with 2 coal thumpers. \n\n\nHelp.",

            "body": "Seeing some misinformed takes on this sub along the lines of \"why are we letting in migrants/refugees/asylum seekers when rents are skyrocketing?\" So I figured I'd leave a few relevant facts here\n\n-[72% of recent migrants to MA are Haitians.](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/03/19/metro/migrant-crisis-massachusetts/#:~:text=Many%20Haitian%20migrants%20are%20drawn,a%20recent%20Boston%20Indicators%20report.) They come here because of our long-established [Haitian community](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/01/26/metro/migrants-waiting-at-logan/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link). In other words, they have friends/family/others who speak their language/a community to catch them here in Boston. \n\n-The situation in Haiti has degraded to the point that the United Nations has called it \"[cataclysmic](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/03/haiti-cataclysmic-situation-demands-immediate-and-bold-action-un-report)\". Gangs are killing the men, raping the women and girls, and recruiting the boys at gunpoint and killing them when they try to escape.\n\n-Asylum seekers are not illegal immigrants. It is legal to come to the U.S. to seek asylum.\n\n-People from these countries are eligible for \"Temporary Protected Status\" in the U.S.: Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Cameroon, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen, and my home country of Ukraine. People on Temporary Protective Status have work permits. [Immigrants participate in the labor force at a higher rate than US-born Americans.](https://usafacts.org/articles/how-many-immigrants-are-in-the-american-workforce/) Native and foreign born unemployment rates are about the same. Migrants also [typically take jobs that U.S.-born citizens don't want](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/06/10/a-majority-of-americans-say-immigrants-mostly-fill-jobs-u-s-citizens-do-not-want/).\n\n-Migrants are [significantly less likely to commit crimes](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2024/03/immigrants-are-significantly-less-likely-to-commit-crimes-than-the-us-born/) than U.S.-born Americans. [An additional source here](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/08/1237103158/immigrants-are-less-likely-to-commit-crimes-than-us-born-americans-studies-find).\n\n-You could be a refugee someday. Two and a half years ago, I lived in a peaceful country, and then Russia invaded, destroying my home. I do not wish it upon you or anyone else. My family and I were received with amazing generosity and hospitality as we crossed to Poland, to Germany, and then to Boston. I love this city and this country with my whole heart, and I am grateful forever.\n\nMost people on earth are good, normal, and just want what is best for them and their families and loved ones. We work, pay taxes, have barbecues with our neighbors. When the neighbor kids accidentally throw the ball over the fence, we throw it back. \n\nIf you hope your child never sees dead bodies lying in the street, then you have something in common with those people sleeping on the floor at Logan Airport.\n\nThere are some people on this sub who say that the crisis in Haiti is 'not our problem'. To those people: I hope that, if you ever have to flee your homes, you are received by people more generous than yourselves.\n\n-Rent is skyrocketing, it's ridiculous and unfair and you deserve better. We all do. But don't blame migrants for it. Blame greedy landlords, blame corporate landlords/real estate management companies that see tenants as exploitable sources of profit rather than human beings, blame zoning regulations that make it difficult to build new housing, blame wages not keeping up with inflation. It's a complex topic with a lot of moving parts. Many of those moving parts have powerful, greedy people moving them. But there have always been migrants coming to the US, so find a better argument.\n\nConclusion: Be a good neighbor, fight the power where you can, thanks for coming to my TED talk",

Why is anyone supporting the perpetrator of a war that has already caused so much destruction and murder of innocent people\n- Also, these were TERRORISTS!!! There's a group in my home country that are similar to Hamas, and if they ever pulled something like this I would never support my country... yet so many support this.\n- Israel has had this land for a decently long time, why is Palestine still fighting for it? They're clearly militarily inferior and can't protect it, they should be taking a peace treaty at all costs\n- I understand the implications of the land being controlled by Israel (Economic troubles and such) but does this really justify the killing of thousands of innocent people?\n- Lastly, it seems Israel is launching a counterattack that to me seems to be fair, they keep getting attacked for the same thing so it's time to shut off Hamas for good. Hamas uses civilians to protect itself while Israel seems to just want to protect its people whatever the cost.\n\nI understand that because of the recent border blockage many Palestenians do not have access to food which is very unjust and horrible to the innocent people, but this has been a common tactic to pressure governments to stop attacks and converse diplomatically or surrender.\n\nThat is all, I'm very open to having my view changed on this matter if I'm persuaded. And just in case this is brought up; I am not from either of these countries or their surrounding areas, and I'm also not originally from any of the countries are actively supporting either side, I hold this view purely out of the information I have provided.",

As such they shouldn't be shamed or anything for voicing this. I think this for the following reasons:\n\n1. It is well known Palestinians by and large are anti LGBT, as such its totally fine to feel uncomfortable promoting such a group at whats meant to be a pride event. After all, said group is against you.\n\n2. It's fine to not want to be associated with another movement you don't fully agree with. Some supporters of Palestine go fairly extreme with outrigt supporting Hamas or spreading outright antisemitism. Its fair for anyone to not want their flag flying alongside another flag they may disagree with itself, or disagree with elements of.\n\n3. It's fine to want pride marches and events to actually focus on Pride. Attaching other social causes to all of them just kinda dilutes the message and energy. Its totally fine for someone to prefer focusing on Pride Flags and the Pride community first and foremost; and thus wanting to avoid the inclusion of other flags.",

But it doesn't actually help Palestine or do anything to vote for a third party. \n\nI feel this way because I have yet to hear anyone explain why they are voting FOR a third party and not just \"I don't want to vote for Harris\" or \"it's a protest vote\" and nothing further. I've never heard anyone explain how it will actually HELP anyone.\n\nTo be clear I don't think voting for Harris will really help Palestine either. She has made her stance clear. She is very pro-Israel. And I don't think that is going to change any time soon. \n\nI think what activists should focus on instead is BDS, getting universities to divest, and mutual aid to those living under siege in Gaza. Along with making sure Palestinian stories are not forgotten. Bearing witness to what is happening. Humanizing Palestinians.\n\nVoting third party however, is not going to help. It's not actually doing anything. It's not actually helping anyone. If you want to vote for a third party that's up to you. Tell me your reasoning for it and how you think it will help. I'd honestly love to be proven wrong.\n\nEdit:\n\nYall. This is not a debate on Israel vs Palestine. That is not the point of this post. The point is if voting a third party will actually advance Palestinian rights in any way. Please stick to that.\n\nEdit 2: good lord this post blew up. I'll read more of the comments later\n\nEdit 3: can mods lock this post it's going off the rails as people are debating Israel vs Palestine instead of the actual point \n\nEdit 4:\n\nI've responded to a lot of comments. I'm done now cuz I actually have better things to do lol. I can't fucking wait for this election to be over",

            "body": "I want to begin by saying I am asking this in good faith - I like to think that I'm a fairly reasonable, well-informed person and I would genuinely like to understand why I seem to feel so different about this issue than almost all of my friends, as well as most people online who share an ideological framework to me.\n\nI genuinely do not understand why people seem so emotionally invested in the outcome of the Israeli-Palestinian Crisis. I have given the topic a tremendous amount of thought and I haven't been able to come up with an answer.\n\nNow, I don't want to sound callous - I wholeheartedly acknowledge that what is happening in Gaza is horrifying and a genocide. I condemn the actions of the IDF in devastating a civilian population - what has happened in Gaza amounts to a war crime, as defined by international law under the UN Charter and other treaties.\n\nHowever - I can say that about a huge number of ongoing global conflicts. Hundreds of of thousands have died in Sudan, Yemen, Syria, Ethiopia, Myanmar and other conflicts in this year. Tens of thousands have died in Ukraine alone. I am sad about the civilian deaths in all these states, but to a degree I have had to acknowledge that this is simply what happens in the world. I am also sad and outraged by any number of global injustices. Millions of women and girls suffer from sex trafficking networks, an issue my country (Canada) is overtly complicit in failing to stop (Toronto being a major hub for trafficking). Children continued to be forced into labour under modern slavery conditions to make the products which prop up the Western world. Resource exploitation in Africa has poisoned local water supplies and resulted in the deaths of infants and pregnant women all so that Nestle and the Coca Cola Company can continue exporting sugary bullshit to Europe and North America.\n\nAll this to say, while the Israel-Palestinian Crisis is tragic, all these other issues are also tragic, and while I've occasionally donated to a cause or even raised money and organized fundraisers for certain issues like gender equality in Canada or whatnot, I have mostly had to simply get on with my life, and I think that's how most people deal with the doomscrolling that is consuming news media in this day and age.\n\nNow, I know that for some people they feel they have a more personal stake in the Israel-Palestine Crisis because their country or institution plays an active role in supporting the aggressor. But even on that front, I struggle to see how this particular situation is different than others - the United States and by proxy the rest of the Western world has been a principal actor in destabilizing most of the current ongoing global crises for the purpose of geopolitical gain. If anyone has ever studied any history of the United States and its allies in the last hundred years, they should know that we're not usually on the side of the good guys, and frankly if anyone has ever studied international relations they should know that in most conflicts all combatants are essentially equally terrible to civilian populations. The active sale of weapons and military support to Israel is also not particularly unique - the United States and its allies fund war pretty much everywhere, either directly or through proxies. Also, in terms of active responsibility, purchasing any good in a Western country essentially actively contributes to most of the global inequality and exploitation in the world.\n\nNow, to be clear, I am absolutely not saying \"everything sucks so we shouldn't try to fix anything.\" Activism is enormously important and I have engaged in a lot of it in my life in various causes that I care about. It's just that for me, I focus on causes that are actively influenced by my country's public policy decisions like gender equality or labour rights or climate change - international conflicts are a matter of foreign policy, and aside from great powers like the United States, most state actors simply don't have that much sway. That's even more true when it comes to institutions like universities and whatnot.\n\nIn summary, I suppose by what I'm really asking is why people who seem so passionate in their support for Palestine or simply concern for the situation in Gaza don't seem as concerned about any of these other global crises? Like, I'm absolutely not saying \"just because you care about one global conflict means you need to care about all of them equally,\" but I'm curious why Israel-Palestine is the issue that made you say \"no more watching on the side lines, I'm going to march and protest.\"\n\nLike, I also choose to support certain causes more strongly than others, but I have reasons - gender equality fundamentally affects the entire population, labour rights affects every working person and by extension the sustainability and effective operation of society at large, and climate change will kill everyone if left unchecked. I think these problems are the most pressing and my activism makes the largest impact in these areas, and so I devote what little time I have for activism after work and life to them. **I'm just curious why others have chosen the Israel-Palestine Crisis as their hill to die on, when to me it seems 1. similar in scope and horrifyingness to any number of other terrible global crises and 2. not something my own government or institutions can really affect (particularly true of countries outside the United States).**\n\nPlease be civil in the comments, this is a genuine question. **I am not saying people shouldn't care about this issue or that it isn't important that people are dying** - I just want to understand and see what I'm missing about all this.",

            "body": "First a disclaimer. We are not discussing morality of rocket attacks on Israel. I think that they are a deeply immoral and I will never change my mind about that. We are here to discuss the stupidity of such attacks, which should dissuade even the most evil terrorist from engaging in them (if they had a bit of self-respect). \n\nSo with that cleared up, we can start. Since cca. 2006, rocket attacks on Israel became almost a daily occurence with just few short pauses. Hamas and to a lesser extent Hezbollah would fire quite primitive missiles towards Israel with a very high frequency. While the exact number of the rockets fired is impossible to count, we know that we are talking about high tens of thousands.\n\nOn the very beginning, the rockets were to a point succesful as a terror measure and they caused some casualties. However, Israel quickly adapted to this tactic. The combination of the Iron Dome system with the Red Color early-warning radars and extensive net of bomb shelters now protects Israeli citizens extremely well. \n\nSure, Israeli air defence is costly. But not prohibitively costly. The Tamir interceptor for the Iron Dome comes at a price between 20k and 50k dollars (internet sources can't agree on this one). The financial losses caused by the attacks are relatively negligible in comparison to the total Israeli military budget. \n\nThe rocket attacks have absolutely massive downsides for Palestine though. Firstly, they really discredit the Palestinian cause for independence in the eyes of foreign observers. It is very difficult to paint constant terrorist missile attacks as a path to peace, no matter how inefficient they are. \n\nSecondly, they justify Israeli strikes within Gaza and South Lebanon which lead to both Hamas/Hezbollah losses and unfortunately also civilian casualties. How can you blame the Isralies when they are literally taking out launch sites which fire at their country, though?  \n\nThirdly, the rocket attacks justify the Israeli blockade of Gaza. It is not hard to see that Israeli civilians would be in great peril if Hamas laid their hands on more effective weapons from e.g. Iran. Therefore, the blockade seems like a very necessary measure. \n\nFourth problem is that the rocket production consumes valuable resources like the famous dug-up water piping. No matter whether the EU-funded water pipes were operational or not (that seems to be a source of a dispute), the fragile Palestinian economy would surely find better use for them than to send them flying high at Israel in the most inefficient terrorist attack ever. \n\nThere is a fifth issue. Many of the rockets malfunction and actually fall in Palestinian territories. This figures can be as high as tens of percents. It is quite safe to say that Hamas is much more succesful at bombing Palestine than Israel. \n\nYet, the missile strikes have very high levels of support in the Palestinian population. We do not have recent polls and the numbers vary, but incidental datapoints suggest that high tens of percents of Palestinians support them (80 percent support for the missile attacks (2014) or 40 percent (2013) according to wiki). I absolutely don't understand this, because to me the rockets seem so dumb that it should discourage even the worst terrorist from using them. \n\nTo change my view about sheer stupidity of these terror strikes, I would have to see some real negative effect which they have on Israel or positive effect which they have on Palestine.

This is terrorism, plain and simple. In a couple instances it was Israeli soldiers which is at least not innocent civilians but the way they treated their bodies and paraded them and stomped on them is disgusting. I can now see why Israel needs to defend itself and it's people. I don't think they should be bombing equally innocent people on the Palestine side but I can see why they should defend themselves because the things I saw today we're revolting and horrific. I still think both sides should still strive to find peace but I am not sure if this is even possible after today's acts.

Although they were masked, community residents recognized one - Shem Tov Luski. The settlers, three of whom were carrying clubs, approached one of the Harini family's homes, swore at family members and claimed that the land, the house and the nearby well all belonged to them. Luski also sexually harassed a member of the family, mentioned military detention facility Sde Teiman and implicitly threatened him with rape.\n\nThe residents and international activists who were there called the police, who did not send officers and only suggested the residents go to the police station in the settlement of Kiryat Arba and file a complaint.\n\nThe three settlers who arrived by car left the area only after about two hours, while the settler on horseback continued grazing his herd in the family's barley field for about an hour.",

Two doctors said she was shot in the head.\n\n>\u201cI\u2019m absolutely devastated. The whole community is,\u201d said Aria Fani, an assistant professor of Middle Eastern languages and cultures at UW who had taught Eygi in a translation studies class and got to know her well. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge tragedy.\u201d\n\n>Eygi had recently arrived in the area to show solidarity with Palestinians, Fani said.\n\n>Fani said he had seen Eygi about two months ago and urged her not to go to the West Bank because he was worried for her safety there.\n\n>More than a weeklong Israeli military operation at refugee camps in Jenin in the West Bank had left dozens dead.\n\n>The operation was part of a major escalation of violence in the West Bank since the start of the Israel-Hamas war on Oct. 7, including Israeli raids and Palestinian militant attacks, increased Israeli settler attacks on Palestinians and heavier crackdowns on Palestinian protests. More than 690 Palestinians have been killed, according to Palestinian health officials.\n\n>\u201cShe went to protect Palestinian farmers from settler violence,\u201d Fani said. \u201cI know exactly what she would say right now if she were alive. She\u2019d say, \u2018The only reason I\u2019m in the headlines is because I have American citizenship.\u2019 Which I think is sadly true. We\u2019ve become numb to Palestinian loss.\u201d\n\n>Fani described Eygi as an exceptional student and person, calling her \u201cone of the most brilliant students\u201d he has ever worked with. Eygi\u2019s final project for Fani\u2019s class was translating Turkish poetry into English, Fani said, and Eygi was interested in pursuing a graduate degree in Near East archaeology.\n\n>\u201cI may have been her teacher once, but she will be my teacher for life,\u201d Fani said. \u201cHer courage was exemplary.\u201d\n\n>Eygi was politically active, participating in protests such as one against the Dakota Access Pipeline, Fani said.\n\n>\u201cHer name \\[Aysenur\\] means life and light,\u201d Fani said. \u201cShe was a very principled activist.\u201c\n\n>Fani said Eygi took part in pro-Palestinian organizing at UW last spring and engaged in negotiations with university administrators.\n\n>After weeks of encampments on campus, protesters and administrators eventually struck a deal which included scholarships for students displaced from Gaza.\n\n>\u201cShe would come to my office having barely slept a couple hours the night before, staying up educating herself by listening to Palestinians and their families about their historical trauma, doing research,\u201d Fani said.\n\n>Carrie Perrin, the academic services director of UW\u2019s psychology department, met Eygi as her academic adviser and said she came to know her as a friend.\n\n>\u201cShe was a bright light who carried with her warmth and compassion,\u201d Perrin wrote in an email. \u201cHer communities were made better by her life and her death leaves hearts breaking around the world today.\u201d\n\n>Eygi received her associate degree from Seattle Central College in 2022, according to a Seattle Colleges commencement program.\n\n>\u201cWe are aware of the tragic death of an American citizen, Aysenur Eygi, today in the West Bank,\u201d U.S. ambassador to Israel Jack Lew posted on X shortly after 7 a.m. Friday. \u201cWe are urgently gathering more information about the circumstances of her death, and will have more to say as we learn more. We have no higher priority than the safety and security of American citizens.\u201d\n\n>U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, who represents most of Seattle, said her office is working to gather more information on the events that led to Eygi\u2019s death. She said she was troubled by reports that Eygi was killed by Israeli soldiers and criticized the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government.\n\n>\u201cThe killing of an American citizen is a terrible proof point in this senseless war of rising tensions in the region,\u201d Jayapal said in a statement.\n\n>Eygi was also a Turkish citizen, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesperson Oncu Keceli said, adding that the country would exert \u201call effort to ensure that those who killed our citizen is brought to justice.\u201d\n\n>Eygi was attending a weekly demonstration against settlement expansion, protests that have grown violent in the past: A month ago, American citizen Amado Sison was shot in the leg by Israeli forces, he said, as he tried to flee tear gas and live fire.\n\n>The top United Nations court in July had called for Israel to stop building settlements in the West Bank, saying Israel was impeding Palestinians\u2019 right to self-determination and was violating international laws against acquiring territory by force.\n\n>Netanyahu had denounced the nonbinding opinion issued by the court, saying the territories are part of the Jewish people\u2019s historical homeland.\n\n>Eygi was a volunteer with the International Solidarity Movement, the pro-Palestinian activist group said in its statement.\n\n>The group said residents have been gathering and praying rather than marching or chanting \u201cdue to escalating aggression by the Israeli forces.\u201d\n\n>The group, which called Eygi \u201ca martyr,\u201d said she died shortly after being transported to a hospital in Nablus.\n\n>Two International Solidarity Movement activists \u2014 Rachel Corrie from Olympia and British photography student Tom Hurndall \u2014 were killed in Gaza in 2003.\n\n>Corrie was crushed to death in March 2003 as she tried to block an Israeli military bulldozer from demolishing a Palestinian home in the southern Gaza town of Rafah near the Egyptian border.\n\n\\*Updated the post to include the updated article",

If you're passing through Beit Jala, a stop at Al Makhrour is a must,\" a comment from 2015 reads on its Facebook page.\n\nRamzi Kisiya who had inherited the land opened a restaurant in 2001 there with his wife and their four children. For years, hundreds of tourists passing through Bethlehem stopped there for a salad before continuing their hike in the green valleys.\n\nFor a long time, the Makhrour valley was untouched by uncontrolled Israeli settlements, but the trouble began in 2012 when an Israeli outpost a settlement not authorised by the government - was built there.\n\nThe settlers demolished the restaurant, claiming it belonged to the JNF. The Kisiya family, who insist otherwise, rebuilt their restaurant before it was demolished again in 2013 and then again in 2015. In 2019 the family decided to take the case to court to have their rights heard. But in 2023, a civil court in Jerusalem validated the expropriation.\n\nIn a bid to prevent the family's restaurant from being rebuilt again, the Israeli army declared the site to be a \"closed military zone\", which prevented anyone from entering it until this nast summer when Israeli\nsettlers backed by soldiers destroyed it once again.\n\nIsraeli settlers backed by the army seized the 5,000 square-metre plot on July 31 and evicted the French-Palestinian family. \"We are being targeted because we reject the government's Zionist policy,\" said Michelle Kisiya.\n\nExpulsions of Palestinians from their land in West Bank have increased, particularly since Israel's far-right government came to power in 2022. The situation has sharply deteriorated since Israel's invasion of Gaza last year.\n\n @savealmakhrour",

If someone more informed then me in the comments wants to correct me that\u2019s fine!\n\nBut it feels like counter protestors are justifying their shitty actions by using words im not sure if many people in the encampment know the meaning of? or atleast i didn\u2019t idk, unless someone in the comments correct me im not going to chant about to the river to the sea or the intifada anymore, all it does it gives counter protestors ammo to be shitty (maybe they would\u2019ve been shitty anyway and i\u2019m being naive)\n\nIt feels like protestors are doing so much work to allow the protests to be peaceful and good meaning. and they are! but if what the counter protestors is saying is true, should we be focused more on ending the war and chanting about freeing Palestine then chanting slogans that equate to the death of Jews? idk, don\u2019t get me wrong a lot of counter protesters were saying very dumb shit but i do think they have a point here?",

However when implemented as a collective action it results in bodies scraped off busses and cafes and other places that were suicide bombed by Palestinians. This is the reality of intifada, I grew up here in Israel in the early 2000's\n\nHere are some example of how \"Intifada\" is implemented in reality and not a class of linguistics. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphinarium_discotheque_massacre\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_University_bombing\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shmuel_HaNavi_bus_bombing\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiryat_Menachem_bus_bombing\n\n(There are many more of these) \n\nI might be biased, but when I hear the slogan \n\"There is only one solution - intifada revolution\"\nTo me that it is a call for a repeat of what intifada really means.\n\nI don't know the full extent of how free speech works in America but I am pretty sure that direct calls for violence aren't protected speech. And it is pretty compelling that implementation of \"intifada\" entails usage of violence against civilians, which is genocidal in my books. \n\nI know Jesse visited Israel, idk how did he miss the memo on what \"Intifada\" actually means.",

This in turn stokes an equal and opposite reaction in the wider public.\n\nWith my limited knowledge of global politics, I would personally support a ceasefire in Gaza. I believe this view has pretty broad support (at least in the U.K.) The scenes coming through from the conflict are just too horrific to continue. \n\nThis view is made controversial by calls for a \u2018global intifada\u2019 or \u2018from the river to the sea\u2019 or such other euphemisms for the destruction of the state of Israel (which I definitely do not support).\n\nI suspect some might argue \u201cwhen people say global intifada it just means \u2018rising up against oppression\u2019\u201d.\n\nI believe students know this phrase is incendiary and intimidating, with global connotations of violence. They deliberately stoke tensions by not simply calling for a ceasefire, but scaring people with divisive rhetoric. The aim being more about showing off to their friends, than affecting peaceful change.\n\nThis is then seen and broadcast by news organisations that are already unfriendly to minorities. Viewers see this rhetoric and conflate it with the views of ordinary Muslims in the west. \n\nThe net result is it feeds into pre existing fears about Islamic extremism, and pushes people further into full blown islamaphobia. Which we can see evidenced in the elections across Europe (Reform U.K., French National Rally, AfD in Germany all making huge gains). \n\nAs usual, poor minorities get hurt, whilst wealthy students get likes and shares. \n\nCMV.\n\n",

Many Jewish youth are feeling bullied, threatened and are saying that it is unsafe for Jews to attend universities like Rutgers. These incendiary demonstrations are creating an atmosphere of hostility that\u2019s being perceived as being antisemitic by many. \n\nIt's reminiscent to many Jews of darker times, when Jews were targeted and it became unsafe to be Jews, especially when assailants cover their faces and chant slogans, that some are interpreting as having genocidal undertones.\n\nIn the video taken at Rutgers below, pro Palestinian mobs are clearly saying 1) They don't want two states, they are calling for Israel to not exist \"we don\u2019t want two states, we want 48\" 2) They are promoting  intifadas which are historically violent \"globalize intifada\u201d and the \"only one solution\" phrase is being interpreted  by many Jews as a play off of words of \"final solution\" and this doesn\u2019t seem to be a coincidence 3) They are supporting \"resistance\u201d which is often used as a euphemism for terrorism.\n\nBy terrifying our young Jewish students, by making them feel unsafe, this should be regarded as something very serious,  alarming and even potentially dangerous. \n\n The rhetoric being used by the Israel hating mob in the video linked below could arguably be classified as hate speech (By the ADL for example), and is being perceived as inciting violence. \n\n  Equating Zionism, which historically is an indigenous peoples\u2019 rights movement with racism is dangerous and contributes to the othering of our Jewish youth at universities. \n\n  Anyone, who doesn\u2019t condemn these clear calls for violence are complicit. We must stand up for the rights of the super minority class that are Jews, POC, one of the most persecuted and smallest minority groups. \n\nWe should be very alarmed that White Supremacists are attending Pro Palestinian demonstrations and are finding common ground with those opposed to Israel\u2019s existence.\n\nWe cannot allow ourselves to be bullied and intimidated by angry mobs. That hasn\u2019t ended well for Jews in the past.\n\nWhat do you think? Will you stand with Jews against hatred? \n\n[Jewish Students At Rutgers Being Harassed By Angry Mob calling for Global Intifa](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZPRTq7YkB/)\n\n\n",

I call for reform of Israel\u2019s current policies and I support freeing Palestine but I don\u2019t feel comfortable chanting \u201cIntifada\u201d due to the anti-Semitic implications. Please comment your thoughts and opinions. Please be civil, I am coming from a place of pure curiosity.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not sure what I expected but I appreciate the attention and discourse this post has created around this issue. After reading all of your comments, I have come to a conclusion. \n\nI believe that chanting \u201cintifada\u201d and \u201criver to the sea\u201d are anti-Semitic due to the context and message pro-Palestine protestors are trying to send. \n\nFurther, I\u2019ve given it a lot of thought and I believe we are all missing the actual point. PEOPLE ARE DYING. And it\u2019s not because we ourselves are letting it happen. There\u2019s not much we can do from where we are. In fact, we are doing more harm than good by taking attention away from the actual issues by protesting for no reason. Protesting can only do so much and interfering with campus activities/classes/raiding PSB is purely selfish. A more effective and mature way of helping the situation (which is what I assume the protestors initially wanted to do) is to call our local reps who all voted to send weapons and funding to Israel. \n\nI also take responsibility for taking away attention from the actual issue by bringing up a different aspect of the situation: anti-semitism. Yes, it exists and the protestors are enabling it and encouraging others to blindly join in. However, we all need to grow up (including myself) and do what we can to have our voices heard and create effective change the right way. Call your reps people!\n\nSomeone created a petition to disband the encampment in the quarry. I signed it and maybe you should think about signing it too but make sure to make an informed decision.

            "body": "The Palestinian cause for statehood is somewhat paradoxical in its current state. \n\nOn one hand they claim they want statehood yet have refused ever offer for peace. They want statehood, but recognition for Israel is seemingly impossible for them to stomach.\n\nAnd on the other hand, they talk about intifada revolutions, and freeing Palestine from the river to the sea, essentially arguing that there has to be a violent reckoning or revolution to ultimately dismantle Israel. \n\nThese two goals, however, cannot coexist. \n\nThe idea that the Palestinian extremist groups, along with Hezbollah etc, can use military force to dismantle Israel is a fantasy based on propaganda that many have unfortunately bought into. Meanwhile, the longer that extremist groups rely on violence to achieve political aims, the more unlikely it is that a Palestinian state will come to be.\n\nFor instance, terrorist acts like 10/7 force Israel to increase their security demands as part of any future Palestinian statehood agreement. The Palestinians don't like this but can't live in a bubble wherein they engage in violent resistance for decades and then get mad about measures put in place to prevent terror attacks. For instance, the idea that a Palestinian state should have a full-on military after 10/7 is simply a non-starter at this point. Imagine, for instance, Hamas with a fully stocked and sophisticated arsenal of weapons, tanks etc. Because of this, the longer and more fervently that Palestinians and their supporters advocate for intifada revolution, the less likely a Palestinian state will result because they'll find necessary security considerations too onerous.\n\nIronically, the Palestinians today are fighting for borders they could have had easily decades ago if they opted for peace over violence. And yet, calls for violent destruction of Israel and the fantasy of Palestine taking the place of Israel remains constant no matter where you look (west bank schools, university protests etc.) It's as if zero lessons have been learned.\n\nThe Palestinians can get a lot more through peaceful coexistence rather than violent resistance. I'm not sure how many more decades of failure will it take for this lesson to be learned.\n\nThe reality is that if the Palestinians ever get a country, it will not be through some heoric battlefield victories, or endless years of terrorist attacks. It will come when they opt to put terror behind them, admit Israel as an entity isn't going anywhere, and compromise for peace. This includes making some tough compromises, something Palestinian leaders have historically been unwilling to make.\n\nWhat's interesting is that according to one of Arafat's aides, one of the reasons Arafat refused peace is because he was uncomfortable with the idea of Palestinian statehood emerging via a peace deal with Israel. As in, who the hell is Israel to grant us OUR statehood. In his mind, a Palestinian state had to emerge from strength and might, not boring old diplomacy.",

We were chanting \u201cpeaceful protest\u201d all night and getting assuaged by counter protesters.\n\nI don\u2019t care anymore. Our words were not nearly as harmful as Counterprotesters actions. I sat at the barricade playing tug of war with a 40 year old man. I\u2019m disappointed it took LAPD 4 hours to show up. \n\nI\u2019m disappointed 40 years from now when UCLA tries to post this moment on their instagram to show how progressive and politically active the school is.\n\nI wish protestors would use less hateful language, but it really means nothing in retrospect to the incredibly disgusting behavior of last night. \n\nIf you\u2019re someone who has spent the last few days talking about how annoyed you are walking an extra five minutes to class, please have respect for your fellow students who spent last night being assaulted. Thank you.\n",

I imagine the people who understand the meaning have romanticized it to mean some type of revolution, maybe they are even using it \"metaphorically\" . I think people need to understand what they are referring to. I hope Palestinians get a state, this isn't about denying anyone their struggle but it is actually possible to get there through diplomacy, (example the pressure from the Americans and the Saudis). the glorification of violence of civilians is despicable. And I'm not sure people are aware of the brutality of the second intifada, also without this context people can never understand why so many Israelis are radicalized against Palestinians\n\nYou needed to fear going into any public space or riding any bus. until today Israelis call the police if they see an unattended bag and every public space has a guard and a metal detector. terrorists would enter a bus full of regular people going to work or school and detonate an explosive vest. the bombs were packed with nails and sharp objects to inflict maximum injuries. sometimes there would be a secondary explosion timed to be triggered by first responders as a booby trap. Some famous bombings were in the Dolphinarium night club where they blew up a bunch of young people dancing, or in Sbarro pizza where they exploded people getting something to eat. the aftermath of these attacks where horrific body parts strewn everywhere and the fear of knowing it could happen anywhere anytime. this period is what directly led to many of Israels most criticized and oppressive policies in the West Bank- the \"apartheid\" wall, check posts, heavy use of administrative detention, bulldozing homes of terrorists - these measures certainly can be criticized but they also ended the second intifada. and one could certainly argue from the Palestinian perspective the intifada brought them much greater suffering and much farther from a state. \n\nSo why are you calling for this in the West?\nI never see any good materials on this- news archives, photographs, accounts of the intifada, if anyone has good resources could you share it because I think it needs to be seen. human emotional accounts, testimonies and images work on people much better than reading a Wikipedia page about a suicide bombing",

At first I just let out a big sigh and I thought maybe they will get rid of it? It was my first time here. I return a second time, a few weeks later and see it\u2019s still there. I am educated on the political conflict, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but isn\u2019t this a chant to incite global violence against us/Jewish people? \n\nI\u2019m ashamed to admit but I chickened out of saying anything to the baristas/management. Im not one to be stereotypical but I have a feeling that the management probably knows\u2026and doesn\u2019t care. I\u2019m not going to make any concrete assumptions. I thought maybe instead I will come in one day with my own sharpie and quietly cross it out completely, so nobody will find out. I just don\u2019t know if that\u2019s lowkey illegal? Seeing that phrase for the first time in real life really caused up a whirlwind of emotions. Not sure how to feel at this moment. \n\nedit:  had the time to go back and see if the writing was still up, just two days ago. to my surprise it was gone!! completely wiped out. \n",

Nothing wrong, and a lot is right, about wanting to see better for innocents in Gaza. But attacking jews as people and shouting threats abt ending israel are not steps toward peace.\"\n\nJust remember, the slogans you are marching with have meanings.\n\nWhen you say river to the sea, that means all of Palestine.\n\nWhen you say free Palestine, you are advocating for the displacement and potential genocide of all Jews. I think there room to debate what this means, but it seems pretty obvious. \n\nAnd apparently the majority of progressives support giving the entire region to Hamas?? A group of people who have promised the destruction of America, to kill every Jew on the planet, that killed all of the PLO in Gaza after winning their election, that I thought we were blaming Netanyahu for, and that would kill everyone marching in the queer parade for Gaza... \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nThe conflict did not start in 1947, it did not start in 1936, and it didn't even start at the beginning of the 1900s. The revisionist history of this region, for a group of people who didn't even consider themselves Muslim as an identity until the 1960s has been appalling. The majority of Arabs who make Gaza and the West Bank weren't even there 200 years ago... \n\nThe president of Harvard University being unable to condemn calling for the genocide of a group of people, because they are jewish has been... revealing... \n\nI don't blame Fetterman for no longer identifying as a progressive, why would he? The label had been ruined by people like Krystal, who think its cute that she is siding with the university presidents. \n\n(Donated to Fetterman).",

Many of them were chanting glory to the Intifada, but I don\u2019t understand why considering the intifada wants to kill all Jews and demolish the west according to the Hamas leaders themselves. If I\u2019m not mistaken intifada means resistance, similar to a holy war the way the Christian\u2019s had the crusades. With all this established, I have questions to ask all the Palestine supporters.  \n\nQuestion 1: Do you support a two state solution? If so, how will the land distribution work? If not, what will happen to the Jews who have to leave the land who are innocent just like the Palestinians who lost their land? \n\nQuestion 2: Do you support the resistance? (Hamas). If so, why do you support them especially since they are willing to kill Palestinians themselves and also killed Muslims when entering Israel even though they are supposed to be fighting for freedom of Muslims? \n\nTo make this Laurier related, I\u2019m asking laurier students about this. Also, side note, why is this situation so polarized that people refuse to talk to one another about it? Hate crimes are on the rise and it\u2019s precisely because people are blaming the supporters of the side they disagree with and attacking them instead of having civil discussion.",

I\u2019ve tried to explain to fellow Jews that calling for an intifada doesn\u2019t mean someone supports THAT particular implementation of it. But\u2026I\u2019ve been met with a lot of skepticism. They tell me that while the word might mean something different, that the folks chanting it mean the exact type of intifada that we\u2019re thinking of.

An unrelated incident, Ben Gvir was involved in a car accident recently, and appears relatively unharmed. \n\nA few small scale protests / encouters with the IDF maybe near Jenin or some border towns.\n\nBut as a whole, we have not seen any major, sustained Palestinian uprising, similar in scale to the previous First Palestinian Intifada and Second Palestinian Intifada. \n\nThe catalyst for the First Palestinian Intifada is generally said to have be when an Israeli truck at the Erez Crossing caused a crash that killed four Palestinians (Gazans from Jabalia refugee camp). In response, riots broke out in Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp and spread. During the First Intifada, an estimated 200 Israeli casualties and 2,000 Palestinian casualties.\n\nThe catalyst for the Second Palestinian Intifada began in response to Israeli politician Ariel Sharon provocative visit to the Al-Aqsa compound, which is situated atop the Temple Mount in East Jerusalem after the collapse of US-sponsored peace talks ; the visit itself was peaceful, but, as anticipated, sparked protests and riots that Israeli police put down with rubber bullets, live ammunition, and tear gas. During the Second Intifada, an estimated 1,000 Israeli casualties and 3,000 Palestinian casualties.\n\n8 months on, as war continues in Gaza, death toll continue to rise, some hostages still held in captivity, devastation, looming food insecurity, etc\u2026 and yet we dont see a Third Palestinian Intifada ? Why ? Correct me if I am wrong, I think Hamas did call for an intifada, an uprising of the Palestinan people, but that seem to went unanswered. Why? Pro-Palestinian protesters in the west has and had chanted Global Intifada, and yet the call went unanswered by the actual Palestinians and Arab Israelis living in Palestine and Israel. Why ?\n\nWe seen alot of Pro-Palestinian protests in the west, student campus encampment, blocking of roads, weekly marches, some arrests/ some violence, etc\u2026. but not seen or heard much of any significant Palestinian uprising/ protests by the actual Palestinians and Arab Israelis living in Palestine and Israel themselves. Why ?\n\n\n",

It's not targeting any specific Muslim on campus, so it shouldn't be intimidating anyone right?\n\nAnd don't tell me that Nakba is a call for a violence, my personal interpretation is that it is the call for the peaceful and non-violent (forceful) removal of all Muslims from Israel. **Yes, I am being a dick on purpose.** However, both the first and second Intifads were notoriously violent against the jewish people. You don't get to pick and choose how groups of people interpret a word, just because it fits an agenda.\n\nFree Palestine, clearly means the removal of all Jews from the region. Because it isn't about Gaza or the West Bank, it's about the region Palestine. A region that got its name from the Romans, who renamed the kingdom of Jerusalem after it's enemies the Philistines... who aren't even connected to Arabs ancestrally. The term itself means invader to Jews, which is rich that you have a enormous population of Arabs who migrated to the region over the past 300 years, who took on the faith of Muslim, and now identify as the term invader...\n\nThis whole situation is so fucked, and I wish BP would actually bring on people to have a real conversation about the conflict and history of the region, rather than spreading Hamas propaganda unapologetically... \n\nPierce Morgan, has done a spectacular job of exposing a lot of these pro Palestine people for who they are, because they absolutely refuse to call October 7th a terrorist attack or condemn it.

The anger towards Palestinian protesters seems to be rooted in uses of language such as \"Intifada\" and \"From the River to the Sea\" A quick Google search defined \"Intifada\" as a \"Civil uprising\" or \"Shaking off\". Without much research it seems that this is in reference to two seperate Palestinian resistance efforts against Israeli occupation, the first of which most mostly non-violent and the second of which was violent.\n\nI found some Jewish sources such as the American Jewish Committee, who point towards the violent nature of the word and some Palestinian sources such as this: [https://remix.aljazeera.com/aje/PalestineRemix/intifada.html](https://remix.aljazeera.com/aje/PalestineRemix/intifada.html)  that point towards Jewish actions   \ncausing incitement of the uprising. \r  \n\r  \nI am curious if the true intent of the proteters was in the sense of a civil uprising or callling for a violent uprising against the Jews?

Other comments have said it\u2019s not about gaining anything, but about dying for the sake of defying Israel, which actually strongly supports my argument and suggests that these commenters do NOT want peace and really don\u2019t care about Palestinians, only about virtue-signaling that they\u2019re anti-colonialism. Another common argument which, to be frank, I find disgusting is the idea that international Western support rests on Palestinian violence against Israelis. This is plain wrong if you only look at it at face value, since only sickos cheer on blind indiscriminate violence targeted deliberately at civilians, either Israelis or Palestinians, regardless of which side you take in the conflict. The only really plausible reasoning I found is that Palestinian violence elicits a strong retaliation from the IDF, creating much pain and suffering for innocent Palestinians, which is used to garner international sympathy. This basically justifies the cynical use of Palestinians by their own leadership, exacerbating their situation in order to gain international points which translates to funds going to Qatar. This isn\u2019t doing the Palestinians any favor and cynically sacrifices Palestinian lives for international sympathy. This, it actually reinforces the Israeli-narrative that Hamas and co endorse attacks by the IDF on innocents for donations. You guys should *really* think about what you\u2019re saying. \n\n**The only actual convincing argument was as follows:**\n\n1. **OSLO ACCORDS**: came about after the 1st intifada. What birthed the accords is very complex, and can be attributed to very high counts of lone-wolf type terrorism with many Israeli casualties and likewise a strong retaliation from the IDF, along with internal politics in Israel and the PLO together with Norway, US and other countries in the west that pushed the two belligerents into signing the Camp David Accord in 2000. The intifada has definitely *not* helped the Palestinians\u2019 situation overall: up until then they had free passage throughout Israel, no borders/walls/checkpoints, were better off economically and had way less violent tackles with the IDF. The Oslo accords did, on the other hand, afforded the Palestinians the first ever official recognition by Israel, their own semi-autonomous zone, which is far from perfect but much closer to self-determination than before. At least until Arafat died and Abu-Mazen was just too incompetent and corrupt to really govern his territory properly. Anyway, I need to either do more research or discuss this with ya\u2019ll. \n\nTimeframe: pre-48 escalation up to present day.\n\n*Every* violent act of resistance or terrorism has carried negative long-teen consequences to Palestinians\u2019 quality of life, without actually managing to obtain anything other than international sympathy. The negative consequences include military retaliation, harsher restrictions, further radicalization of  Israelis which obviously affects the Palestinians and only aids in perpetuating the cycle of violence.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying all of Israel\u2019s policies are a consequence of Palestinian terrorism, but, depending on your outlook, have either elicited or at the very least provided a neat excuse for a response. Notice how most Israeli restrictions just chronologically follow Palestinian violence. For example, the wall dividing the WB from Israel came about after the intifada. The siege of Gaza came after the kidnapping of Gilad Shalit. The 2014 war came after the kidnapping and murdering of 3 teens by Hamas. All these acts have *MASSIVE* repercussions for the average Palestinian. Not to mention smaller-scale attacks with smaller-scale responses.\n\nI\u2019m asking Reddit to provide me with examples for times when Palestinian led violence against Israelis has managed to secure any kind of actual, practical advantage for the Palestinian civilians. Edit: Note I\u2019m **not discussing whether it\u2019s justified or not, or whether Palestinians have a RIGHT to defend themself, just where or not it\u2019s effective**.\n\nDisclaimer: I\u2019m an Israeli citizen, though a very left-wing leaning one (do with it as you will). I *really am looking for a real discussion*, not dishing out \u201cHasbara\u201d. Additionally, I despise being identified as a Zionist although the hardline propalis would consider me as such, and I admittedly have quite a pro-Israeli stance though it\u2019s way softer than expected as I really *do* deeply care about the well-being of Palestinians. Anyway, I\u2019m really knowledgeable about the history of the region so please no making stuff up.\n\nEdit: wow, 60 comments in 40 min! Thank you for the wise insight folks. I promise I\u2019ll get to everyone, but it may take me a few days.\n\nEdit 2: OK 687 comments in 3 hours. Seriously thank you for engaging with this question!!! I don\u2019t *really* think I could really respond to everyone especially that I really take my time with each reply but still I\u2019ll at least read as much as I can!",

And that forest is quite a forest.\n\nDespite our tradgedy, suffering, and humiliation on October 7th, in the wider scope of things, Israel is winning big. Consider our situation on October 6th. We had two massive terrorist armies on our borders, whom if they had attacked together, with Iranian support, could have dealt Israel an existential blow.\n\nNow, one year later Hamas in Gaza is basically non-existent. True, they could survive and slowly build back, but that will be decades, and under a watchful Israeli eye. And true, we don't have the hostages back, but that will in all likelihood be resolved in one way or another.\n\nOn the lebanese front, just last month, we were in fear when Nasrallah would announce he was preparing a speech. Now, Hezbollah is gutted and humiliated. Sure, we shouldn't underestimate and they are still very dangerous, but the strategic equations are broken, and Israel is in many ways free from Hezbollah's stranglehold.\n\nAnd in the West Bank, we have been conducting the most serious operations since the second intifada. True, there's still a lot to do, but we are beginning to regain deterrence there.\n\nAnd most important, Israeli's are awoken from their slumber, and much more aware of our place in the world, global anti semitism, the Iranian threat, the Jordanian border, and the distant Egyptian threat.\n\nAnd despite this year which has broken thousands of Israeli families and put tremendous pressure on our economy, and despite the protests, the country is still functioning pretty well. You can travel, go out to restaurants, and go to work.\n\nQuite an accomplishment. If we can sort out our inane internal divisions, this will be a decade of mega prosperity for Israel\n\nTl;dr Tough year, but we're coming out on top",

            "body": "I'm sure you've seen it. Lots of main reddit comments about how alcohol is an awful poison, weed is the answer, etc, etc.\n\nBefore I talk about this, I do want to bring up that someone close to me is (or was a year ago) a full on alcoholic. If you are drinking multiple drinks every day and often going to bed wasted, that IS a problem. Coincidentally, I come from a Slavic family.\n\nBut in terms of Reddit, you will often see people talk about how horrible any amount of alcohol is for your health, how it has no benefits, how we should thing about making it illegal, etc. Gen Z seems to have embraced some of the \"no partying\" culture as well. [Who is the most sober generation? Gen Z](https://www.deseret.com/2022/9/23/23366775/gen-z-more-sober-than-older-generations)\n\nI never drank in high school and even though I was decently outgoing and athletic, I was absolutely hopeless with women. Just nerves on nerves. Had huge issues with public speaking and generally being around unfamiliar people. Freshman year of college I start drinking and magically make out with four people my first month. Rest of freshman year was kind of uneven, but my other three years I get pretty good at participating in \"hook-up culture\". All of happens when both myself and the other girl are pretty drunk of course. That's the point. Beyond the mindless hookups was plenty of good times making friends, watching dumbass late night TV, eating drunk food, etc. \n\nWas it pretty dumb? Did I have to gradually scale down my drinking every year of my 20s? Yes. But learning how to tastefully consume alcohol was a big part of me breaking out of my shell. Now I'm at a point where I drink here and there but can also have fun and be outgoing without it. And doing dumbass partying in my early 20s helps me be fine with being more solo and going to bed at like 9:30 on Saturdays in my 30s.I see a lot of these terminally online Redditors that fetishize extreme introversion and I'm just like....\"dude just go find some parties\". I had plenty of times being mega awkward at said parties, trying to dance with someone that rejects me, etc....but you learn with experience. Not by sitting at home and whining about being black-pilled.",

No matter how you look at it, Saladin was a very generous man for his time and especially as the head of the biggest caliphate in the world, a kind and respectable man was not to be expected (take that with a grain of salt, the ayyubid dynasty still did plunder and ransacked cities like it was nothing but he was still a good man for his position and time). A single factor keeps me wondering, what was the need of losing thousand upon thousands of life just for one city of minor significance in the grand scheme, even if Kingdom of heaven (very inaccurate but great movie) they want us to understand that this cities is pretty pointless in the grand scheme of battle. I also understood why King Richard wanted it (he was a prideful warlord but one hell of a warrior who wanted to own the holy land) but that just didn\u2019t fit Saladin\n\nDid Saladin need this city for pride reasons or did he need it for strategical advantage. One thing said it was for revenge but that never made sense, Saladin easily could have killed every Christian in the city instead of letting them walk and I even heard he allowed local Christians to stay within the city. It just seemed like a waste of life and it didn\u2019t help in the long run and especially sense Richard got a lot of land back but came to his senses and saw the city for what it was, a risk not worth taking and so they signed a peace deal and ended the war for a little while.",

I am not sure how popular is his opinion, but it\u2019s a great departure from what we are used to hearing from Hamas, Al-Jazeera, Palestinian Authority, news media, UNRWA, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, etc\u2026which often potray that every Gazan would rather be martyred than leave Gaza. Maybe Hamas, Al-Jazeera, UNRWA, HRW, etc\u2026do not speak for every Gazans, there are Gazans who dont want to be martyred and dont want to be part of this conflict.\n\n2. How many Gazans dont want to be martyred and dont want to be part of this conflict anymore ? If Hamas only represents a tiny fraction of the Gazan society, weaken, leaderless, what is the possibility that Gazans could overthrow them ? It was estimated that were 20,000 to 40,000 Hamas fighters, probably half of Hamas fighters dead,\u2026if 2 million ordinary Gazan civilians rose up to beat the s*** out of 20,000 Hamas fighter (even with lightly armed, guns), surely the Gazan population could overwhelm them (I am sure Hamas doesnt have 2 million bullets) ?

            "body": "Hello, I am a pilagrim from Iceland currently staying in the Old City of Jerusalem near Jaffa gate. I am here at this time because of my love for the Jewish nation, which I have (through my reading of the Bible) come to love and cherish as the chosen and sacred nation of God.\n\nHowever, since I am a friend and strong supporter of the Jewish nation and their national home \u2013 the state of Israel \u2013 I do not want to give the wrong signals or be misunderstood as anti-Semetic in any way. I am slowly realizing now how the Jewish people connect the image of the cross to unspeakable atrocities throughout the ages. On behalf of Christians, I want to repent and ask your forgiveness. \n\nWill I offend or hurt Jews by wearing the cross in Jerusalem? It's extremely hard for me to take it off or even putting it inside the shirt because it feels like betrayal to my Lord Yeshua who saved my life.\n\nIn any case, I have been wearing it for four days without any significant problems. But I feel some people are giving me strange looks. I even went into the Arab neighbourhood with it AND a hat with \"Jesus is Lord\" written on it, on my way to the Garden Tomb. I also meet some soldiers wearing the hat and the cross yesterday and said \"God bless the IDF\" and had only positive reactions.\n\nOn another note, I bought a white hat with the flag of Israel today in the Jewish neighbourhood and went grocery shooping with it. I was considering buying an IDF hat but when I asked the seller whether or not the Arabs would kill me he said: It depends on wear you go. So, I opted for the flag of Israel. \n\nI feel like I was perceived more positively when strolling down the Mamilla road with the cross and the Israel hat than only with the cross. I am mostly conserned about the cross, though, since the hats are not a part of my soul like the cross is.  \n\nI'm very confused. My dad is worried that I'm going to get physically assulted for being so open about my religion. I have a month left of my vacation and I don't know what to do. Please help me. I don't want to hurt my Jewish friends. But I can't betray my Lord.\n\nCould you please provide me with honest feedback about the general perception/attitude towards big crosses in Jerusalem and also safety regarding specific areas. Toda kol kach raba!\n\nGod bless Israel. ",

We do not have children as of now. I handle my part of chores in the household(if not even more due to me working from home and being available mostly). I do show her non-sexual attention and gestures such as massaging, kisses, being emotionally available and other things. I explained these because people tend to find fault from my side first after I tell them about the situation. I tried to have many talks with my wife about it but it all boils down to \"we are not married just for sex, stop thinking with your thing down there\" and so on. \n\nHowever, she does not stop herself from teasing me. She'll talk about sex but just reject me afterwards and go to sleep. She'll be flirty but nothing in the end. I asked her if it's a kink and if it's, I am not comfortable with such a thing especially as our sexual life is in shambles. She said it's not a kink and she genuinely does not feel in the mood. I told her to stop teasing me then.\n\nYesterday was our anniversary and we had a great date together. She implied sex and teased me a lot during our time. I was hopeful that we'll do something in the end. Guess what? Once we stepped inside the house, she just showered and went to bed. Cool, I think I should approach. I tried and got rejected in the end. I lost it at that moment and just shouted my frustration at her. I told her I am going to divorce her. I packed my clothes and some important belongings, and left for a hotel. She tried to stop me but could not. She has been calling me non-stop but I just need peace of mind right now. It's just frustrating. Being together with someone but feeling alone and unwanted sucks. On top of that, she gives me hope only to destroy it. I called my lawyer friend this morning and we'll start the divorce proceedings this Monday. I am just done at this point.\n\nAITAH?",

She happily talked about my sister's death while she put on her makeup. It made me sick. My family has decided to have my sister exhumed and cremated. We are tried of people going to her grave and posing for pictures like you would do when you are on vacation and having a good time. We cannot even visit her grave in peace. It has been years and we get no peace. If these crime and murder hobby people see us they bother us. It's bad enough we get people coming to our homes or trying to make friends with us to get information about my sister. But seeing people post pictures of themselves posing at the grave was putting a strain on us. My family decided to have my sister cremated and keep the place we are scattering her ashes a secret. These people who like murder and crime for a hobby make me sick. (And no one don't care if anyone tries to tell me differently or say they have this hobby but are different). I have been sick over this. (If anyone asks for information about my sister I'll ignore it).",

It's always other people who say it when he walks near them or shows up to certain locations. He's for sure cocky about being the best swordsman, we can see that when he is fighting Zoro during the Baratie Arc. \n\nBut there are things to remind us that he doesn't want to chase titles or conquer anything.\n\n1. The panel above explains that he would rather live in peace and let buggy be the face of the new emperor. He doesn't care to have that title or ambitions similar.\n\n2. When he becomes the world's greatest swordsman he looks for a very secluded place for his residence, Shikkearu Kingdom or what we now call Gloom Island. And island that no one wants/can live on anymore because of it being over ran by the apes and other creatures that love there. Again he's seeking a sort of peace. \n\n3. In Volume 108 sbs we learned why Mihawk became a warlord. Mihawk chose to become a warlord to ensure he could live in peace and exclusivity without being constantly chased by the marines, I mean I can still kill these guys with relative ease but again he wants peace. \n\n4. My Favorite point, I think Mihawk is actually looking forward to the day when someone can finally beat him and take his title. I get this feeling from reading the end of the Baratie, where he challenges Zoro to go out there and see the world and get stronger and strive to pass him. I think he wants to hand the title over to someone else so people won't come seeking him for more challenges and he can finally, again, have peace. \n\nThere is probably more examples I can pull up but I don't want to be painfully redundant more than I already am. \n\nThe point of this is to show that if we take the qualities of previous conquers we can see that Mihawk doesn't line up with them. There is no doubt he is one of the strongest in the verse, for sure he's clappin soooo many cheeks when it's comes to fighting but his ambition is not that of a conquers thus I thought this whole time, it would make sense that he doesn't have conquers haki. \n\nThanks for reading.\n\nAll the Mihawk fans are gonna slaughter me here bit I still have him top 5 ",

Jews have been second class citizens for a millennium and were fairly recently killed in a genocide. So yeah, they should have their own state where they can live freely. And the location seems appropriate, considering their historical ties to the land. And they need not kick out/genocide their Palestinian neighbors to do so, they can just\u2026 live next to them?\n\nThis seems like an obvious and inoffensive position. But I see people online trash \u2018zionists\u2019 as if they believe in some kind of jewish superiority. Am I missing something?\n\nEdit: Prior to this, I just read some articles explaining what zionism was, and then I considered the dictionary definition (I know, cringe, but that\u2019s why I\u2019m here). It seems (from comments) some term baggage comes from Israeli politics. Where the \u2018most Zionist\u2019 essentially want to enforce a *strong* Jewish majority and oppress others, which may or may not stem from a sense of racial superiority. ",

It has fought wars with Israel in the past, and it voluntarily renewed hostilities with Israel after the beginning of this iteration of the Gaza war because it saw an opportunity Israel as vulnerable and distracted. \n\nIsrael (I\u2019ll say \u2018allegedly\u2019 for legal reasons, as Israel hasn\u2019t yet admitted to it as of this writing, but, c\u2019mon) devised, and executed, a plan that was targeted, small-scale, effective, and with minimal collateral damage. It intercepted a shipment of pagers that Hezbollah used for communications and placed a small amount of explosives in it - about the same amount as a small firework, from the footage I\u2019ve seen. \n\nThese pagers would be distributed by Hezbollah to its operatives for the purpose of communicating and planning further terrorist attacks. Anyone who had one of these pagers in their possession received it from a member of Hezbollah. \n\nThe effect of this attack was clear: disable Hezbollah\u2019s communications system, assert Israel\u2019s intelligence dominance over its enemies, and minimize deaths. \n\nThe attack confirms, in my view, that Israel has the capability to target members of Hamas without demolishing city blocks in Gaza. It further condemns the IDFs actions in Gaza as disproportionate and vindictive. \n\nI know many people who have been active on social media across the spectrum of this conflict. I know many people who post about how they are deeply concerned for Palestinians and aggrieved by the IDFs actions. Several of them have told me that they think the pager attack was smart, targeted and fair. \n\nI still know several people who are still posting condemnations of the pager attack. Many of them never posted anything about Palestine before October 7, 2023. I belief that most of them are interacting with this issue because it is trendy. \n\nWhat will CMV: proof that the pager attack targeted civilians, suggestions of alternative, more targeted and proportionate methods for Israel to attack its enemies. \n\nWhat will not CMV: anecdotal, unconfirmed tales of mass death as a result of the pager attacks, arguments that focus on Israel\u2019s existence, arguments about Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, or discussions of Israel\u2019s criminal government.

The occupation and settlements in the West Bank are morally wrong in theory and practice and it harms Israel\u2019s legitimacy as a liberal democracy. They must have to be dismantled. I\u2019m not personally involved in this conflict. I think Netanyahu and the Israeli far-right are detestable people who should not be anywhere near power. Israel has overreacted in its bombing of Gaza and are likely causing more civilian casualties than necessary. The recent strike on WCK workers was a terrible and completely avoidable tragedy, and should be independently investigated. Israel\u2019s recent diplomatic behaviour is very problematic and is actively making peace down the road more difficult.\n\nAnyway, the word \u201cZionist\u201d has often been conflated by many pro-Palestinian supporters to exclusively mean a far-right version of Zionism and treated as a slur -  people who support ethnically displacing Palestinians - while the word means [the establishment and continued existence of a Jewish nation-state in the Holy Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism) \\- what is now Israel. It is not a fascist ideology. Not all Jews are Zionists, but the majority of them *are* (at least 80%), a vast majority in Israel - similar to how most people in Turkey would support Turkey continuing to exist, as for the Japanese, Turkish, French, etc. To most Israelis and many of their supporters, Zionism just means that Israel should continue to exist, and many would be satisfied with a two-state solution. Many are inherently sympathetic since they learn about it in school. So when someone goes \u201cNothing against Jews, but *fuck* these Zionist pigs\u201d, Zionist Jews see them as being targeted for what is a common stance around the world. Nothing says Zionism can\u2019t coexist with an independent Palestine, but this common sentiment appears to many eyes, with a large amount of truth, that they want the state of Israel dismantled. \n\nNow I know many ethnicities, like Scots and Kurds, aren\u2019t afforded their own country, and this argument is often brought up as to why the Jews don't have the right to self-determination. But the fact is that Israel exists *now* and has for 70 years, older than Botswana or Bangladesh, and cultivated a strong civic nationalism. No one talks about collapsing Japan so the Ainu could have a state. While Catalonians protest for independence, there are no serious calls for the destruction of Spain. It is not a common sentiment in Darfur, where a genocide is occurring, for Sudan to be dismantled. Understandably, a lot of Jews and Israelis perceive anti-zionism to be anti-semitism.\n\nIsraelis perceive this language as hostile, and in turn they become defensive of Zionism, and some might begin to think there's nothing wrong with the more extreme kind. Israeli has a few nuclear reasons for why it won't ever go down in a fight. \n\nThose who oppose a two-state solution and want a single state over the area known as Palestine are not in agreement over what should happen to the Jewish population - some say that they can stay while others say they should be expelled (notwithstanding that that would be like Native Americans demanding that hundreds of millions of Americans pack up). In either case it's understandable why the majority of Israelis would not support either solution, given how Jews and other religious/ethnic minorities are treated throughout the Middle East and North Africa. In the face of this, Zionism appears sensible. Ask if a Chinese person would feel if they found China filled with 1.4 billion non-Chinese people, or Yemenis if non-Muslims started making up a majority of the population. Even if nothing in their laws prevents that from happening, these countries would fall into conflict long before it could happen.\n\nEdit: I'll add that the insistency of calling the IDF the \"IOF\" is a tad dumb. Nothing about the PLA is \"Liberating\" anything in China but no one calls it anything else.",

By the end of the British Mandate period in 1948, Jewish farmers had cultivated 425,450 dunams of land, while Arab farmers had 5,484,700 dunams of land under cultivation.[22]\n\n>In the 1930s, most of the land was bought from landowners. Of the land that the Jews bought, 52.6% were bought from non-Palestinian landowners, 24.6% from Palestinian landowners, 13.4% from government, churches, and foreign companies, and only 9.4% from fellaheen (farmers).[20]\n\nThe founder himself, Ben gurion said: \"Palestine is grossly under populated.

Zionism is a colonizing adventure.\"\n~Tom Segev, One Palestine, Complete: Jews and Arabs under the British Mandate.\n\nBen gurion actions were widely described as colonialism by many historians, he was the father of modern israel as we know it, his ethnic cleansing of arabs for jewish settlements and his burning of arab villages for jewish settlements is undeniably settler colonialism, the zionist apologetica for that is that he had to do that due to arabs engaging in a war with them, ignoring the fact that that doesn't even negate or absolve settler colonialism or ethnic cleanse.\n\nNetanyahu father(benzion) for instance also was very honest about the intentions of zionism as he perfectly explains what settler colonialism is.\n\n\"The British didn\u2019t leave Palestine because of the Arabs, but because of the Jews. The Jewish resistance was what caused them to leave. We came here to establish a Jewish state in a place that was populated by others, and we did this by force. It is impossible to understand Zionism without this view.\"\n\nhttps://www.antiwar.com/blog/2012/04/03/benzion-netanyahu-and-the-fate-of-palestinians/\n\n>Between 1948 and 1977, when the Labour party dominated politics and culture, the Israeli left disputed the notion that theirs was a colonial project \n\n>.John Collins states that multiple scholars have established that \"the architects of Zionism were conscious and often unapologetic about their status as colonizers whose right to the land superseded that of Palestine\u2019s Arab inhabitants\".[33] \n\nConsidered the father of the movement as we know it, Herzl sought help from multiple colonialists to help him in his colonialist project.\n\n\"In the missive, the Zionist leader writes to the key imperial player that Britain should support the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine as part of the imperial design because \u201cit is something colonial.\u201d\"\n\nNotably herzl was also known for his colonial language, like the well known white man burden.\n\n\"We should there [in Palestine] form a portion of the rampart of Europe against Asia, an outpost of civilization as opposed to barbarism.\" ~herzl\n. \n\n>Yet in the early days, the Zionist movement was astonishingly honest about its existence as a form of colonialism. The founding fathers of Zionism, such as Herzl, Nordau, Ussishkin and Jabotinsky \u2013among others- employed the same colonial tropes and tactics used by Europeans to legitimize their imperialism. Not only was Zionism colonialism in practice\n\n\n>Zionists openly referred to it as such; for example, Herzl sought counsel from Cecil Rhodes on how best to proceed with the process of colonization, describing Zionism as\u00a0\u2018something colonial\u2019. To drive this point even further, the first Zionist bank established was named the \u2018Jewish Colonial Trust\u2019 and the whole endeavor was supported by the \u2018Palestine Jewish Colonization Association\u2019 and the \u2018Jewish Agency Colonization Department\u2019.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Leumi\n\n>Bank Leumi (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05e0\u05e7 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d9, lit.

Its aim was to facilitate the mass emigration of Jews from Russia and other Eastern European countries, by settling them in agricultural settlements on lands purchased by the committee in North America (Canada and the United States), South America (Argentina and Brazil) and Ottoman Palestine. Today ICA is still active in Israel in supporting specific development projects under the name Jewish Charitable Association (ICA).[4]\n\n>At the end of the day it was a group of European settlers claiming an already inhabited land for an exclusivist ethnic state, while planning to\u00a0\u2018spirit the penniless population across the border\u2019\u00a0(herzl quote) through various means. \n\nZe ev jebotsky one of the most well known zionist leaders, the one who created the party that currently rules israel, Likud and the leader of the party that preceded it.\n\n\"It is utterly impossible to obtain the voluntary consent of the Palestine Arabs for converting 'Palestine' from an Arab country into a country with a Jewish majority.\"\n\n\"Zionist colonization, even the most restricted, must either be terminated or carried out in defiance of the will of the native population. This colonization can, therefore, continue and develop only under the protection of a force independent of the local population \u2013 an iron wall which the native population cannot break through.\" \n\n\"And it made no difference whatever whether the colonists behaved decently or not. The companions of Cortez and Pizzaro or (as some people will remind us) our own ancestors under Joshua Ben Nun, behaved like brigands; but the Pilgrim Fathers, the first real pioneers of North America, were people of the highest morality, who did not want to do harm to anyone, least of all to the Red Indians, and they honestly believed that there was room enough in the prairies both for the Paleface and the R3dsk!n. Yet the native population fought with the same ferocity against the good colonists as against the bad\"\n\n\"It is not sufficient to lay claim to what we desire; it must be settled and inhabited. Colonization carries this requirement within it.\" (Ze'ev Jabotinsky, \"The Iron Wall (We and the Arabs))\n\nNot really unexpected from someone who is the founder of the revisionist movement in israel aswell.\n\n>Japotinsky support base was mostly located in Poland, and his activities focused on attaining British support to help with the development of the Yishuv. Another area of major support for Jabotinsky was Latvia, where his speeches in Russian made an impression on the largely Russian-speaking Latvian Jewish community.[31]\n\nArthur Ruppin - A leading figure in the Zionist Organization, who was instrumental in Jewish settlement in Palestine. \n\n\"Zionism is the colonization of Palestine, the displacement of the Palestinian Arab people.\" And \"Our work is a colonization movement in all its aspects.\" ~ \"The Jews in the Modern World\"\n\nMoshe Smilansky,a very well known zionist writer. \n\n\"Settling the land means creating facts that do not come about by talking but by doing, by a daily effort to make something out of the nothing.

Beyond improbability, he worried that this impulse would drain energy away from the task of creating an autonomous Jewish center in the diaspora.[1]:\u200a21\n\n>His formulated ideology became known as Jewish Autonomism,[18][19] once widely popular in eastern Europe, being adopted in its various derivations by Jewish political parties such as the Bund and his Folkspartei.

He is most well known for his role in the Balfour Declaration ,Sokolow was crucial in securing international support for the Zionist cause, particularly in the lead-up to the Balfour Declaration aswell. As a diplomat he worked with Chaim Arlosoroff in lobbying British officials for a declaration that would support the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. His diplomatic efforts extended beyond even Britain, as he also secured backing from France and Italy for the Zionist movement. This endorsement of Zionism was a huge step toward the eventual creation of the State of Israel. He held Many leadership positions within the World Zionist Organization (WZO), including Secretary-General and later President.\n\n> Sokolow represented the Zionist movement in several international forums, including the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, where he argued for the inclusion of the Balfour Declaration in the League of Nations' mandate over Palestine. His ability to present the Zionist cause in a way that aligned with European colonial interests made him an effective advocate in diplomatic circles. In his writings, Sokolow compared the Jewish settlement of Palestine to other colonial ventures by European powers, arguing that Zionism was part of the broader civilizing mission of Europe. He framed the colonization of Palestine as a progressive movement, which aimed to bring European culture, technology, and values to the \"undeveloped\" land of Palestine. His writings were also heavily influential in shaping the narrative of Zionism as a return to a historical homeland, rather than merely a colonial enterprise.\n\nEliezer Kaplan\n\n\"Without the backing of international colonial powers, our colonization would be impossible.\"\n~ Anita Shapira, Land and Power.\n\nHe is a Treasurer of the Jewish Agency and key architect of financial support for Zionist colonization in Palestine.\n\nItzhak Ben-Zvi\n\n\"The struggle for our land is a struggle to replace its current tenants.\"\nThe Invention of the Jewish People.\n\nSecond President of Israel and a important figure in the early Zionist movement.\n\nEliezer Hoofien\n\n\"The rebuilding of the land depends on our ability to colonize it.\"-Palestine and the Great Powers\n\nKnown for Zionist banking and economic development, supported the financial infrastructure needed for Jewish colonization.\n\nBerl Katznelson\n\"Our aim is the colonization of the land, a Jewish return to its historical place.\"\nThe Labor Movement and the Jewish Settlement.\n\nHe is A Labor Zionist intellectual and one of the founders of the Histadrut.\n\nLevi Eshkol- \"Our colonization of the land is a historic return, and it is our right to take it.\"\nLevi Eshkol: The Man and the Nation.\n\nIsrael\u2019s third Prime Minister, Eshkol oversaw significant Jewish settlement expansion during his time in office.\n\nMeir Dizengoff\n\"We must make this land Jewish through colonization.\"\nTom Segev, One Palestine, Complete.\n\nThe first mayor of Tel Aviv, actively promoted Jewish colonization as a necessary meanof creating a Jewish city and state.\n\nEliahu Golomb\n\"Our control over the land must be achieved through settlement, which is the basis of our colonization.\"\n-Tom Segev, One Palestine, Complete.\n\nfounder of the Haganah one of the most well known zionist terrorist paramilitary groups, the one that ben gurion also came from, Golomb believed military force and settlement were intertwined in Zionist colonization.\n\nIsrael Shochat\n\"We must form a Jewish armed force... the future of Zionism depends on force, and we must act as other colonizing movements have acted.\"\n- Land and Power.\n\nFounding member of Hashomer which is a so called \"Jewish defense organization\", Shoshit explicitly referred to Zionism in the context of other colonial movements, stressing the importance of force to achieve his wet dream of an ethno state in Palestine.\n\nEliahu Elath\n- \"We will build the land in the manner that all colonialists build their countries... step by step, quietly but persistently.\"\n- One Palestine, Complete.\n\nZionist diplomat and later Israel\u2019s first ambassador to the U.S. and the U.K.\n\nShimon Peres\n\"The conquest of the land by Jewish settlement has been an act of faith and colonialism.\"\nQuoted in The New York Times, September 14, 1993.\n\nFormer Israeli Prime Minister and President, Peres openly acknowledged the colonial nature of Zionist settlement.\n\nDov Yosef\n\"We must act with the spirit of colonizers and bring life to this land, even if it requires great sacrifices.\"\n- Government and Politics in Israel.\n\nHe was an Israeli military leader, Yosef was involved in managing land policies and viewed the settlement process as a colonial mission.\n\nAbraham Granovsky \n\"The colonization of Palestine is the foundation of Zionism.\"\n- A History of Zionism.\n\nYet another Head of the Jewish National Fund, Granovsky was responsible for purchasing and developing land for Jewish settlement, and saw colonization as central to the Zionist cause.\n\nShmaryahu Levin\n\"Zionism is a colonizing venture... for the return of Jews to their land.\" Zionism and the Jewish Future.\n\nIn the 1920s, Levin was a representative of the\u00a0World Zionist Organization\u00a0and director of the Information Department of\u00a0Keren Hayesod and also a fundraiser for the cause.\n\nMeir Yaari\n\"Our settlement work is the basic foundation of the Zionist enterprise.

Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nI have heard too many people at this point saying that \u201cthe problem isn\u2019t Jews, it\u2019s Zionists.\u201d \n\nFirst of all, 6 out of the ~15 million Jews (one of them being my father) are Israeli, and would very much like it for their country to exist. Outside of that, most diaspora Jews care about Israel existing because we know the history of persecution against our people and want Israel to exist not only for religious reasons, but also as a sanctuary for all Jews. Half of the Israeli population are descendants of Jewish refugees from all Arab countries, and just in the \u201990s Israel had to and was able to let in 1 million former-Soviet Jewish refugees.\n\nOF COURSE there are non-jews who are antisemitic and use Zionism as a cover for Islamophobia.\n\nOF COURSE there are a few crazy Jewish settlers that continue to steak Palestinians homes deep in the West Bank\n\nOF COURSE the Neturei Karta exist, but they are the minority and the vast majority of Jews are still Zionists.\n\nMy point is that just because there are Zionist extremists doesn\u2019t mean that most Zionists are extremists, and that just because there are non-Zionist Jews doesn\u2019t mean that Zionism has nothing to do with Judaism.\n\nI am Jewish and Zionist.

            "body": "The raging debate over Zionism, and the Palestinian obsession with opposing it and blaming it for every Palestinian problem is irrelevant and counterproductive at this point. Zionism is simply the idea that Jews should have their own country in their ancient homeland. It doesn\u2019t preclude the Palestinians from having a home nor does it have anything to do with what the borders of Israel should be.\u00a0\n\nSo why is the debate about Zionism pointless? \n\nBecause Israel already exists. Zionism, as a decolonialist project succeeded. Israel has been around for nearly 80 years, is a thriving democracy, and simply isn\u2019t going anywhere. Arguing against Zionism or Zionists is about as productive as campaigning for the eradication of the United States or any other nation-state, which seems to be a favorite pastime of super progressive lefties who, it would seem, care more about slogans than practical realities.\n\nSadly, people who passionately argue against Zionism and try and equate it with the worst things in the world seem to make the same tragic mistake that the pro-palestinian movement has been making for decades - namely an obsession with dismantling Israel rather than efforts to actually create a Palestinian state. Any nationalist movement that is rooted in the destruction of another is simply bound to fail, as we\u2019ve seen for nearly 8 decades at this point.\n\nThe obsession with zionism is why Palestinians have rejected every peace offer ever made - because when opposing zionism is the root cause of your belief system, it suggests that the ultimate goal isn\u2019t a Palestinian country, but the eradication of Israel and the manufactured boogeyman that is Zionism.\n\nAnti-zionist thinking is certainly productive if you want to rile up the masses into a frenzy, come up with slogans, demonize Israel etc., but it ultimately does absolutely nothing to further along the Palestinian quest for statehood.\n\nAs an example, I recently had a discussion with a Pro-Palestinian classmate of mine. I said that ideally I would like a 2-state solution. Palestinians in a country living peacefully next to Israel. His response? \u201cThat\u2019s impossible as long as Israel and zionism exist. Palestinians have no problem with jews, but the zionist state is on Palestinian land. The problem,\u201d he emphasized, \u201cwas and remains Zionism.\u201d\n\nThe ahistorical aspect of his answer aside, it reflects the problem above - a preoccupation with getting rid of Israel instead of creating Palestine. The obsession with Zionism is a microcosm of this counterproductive and ultimately pointless line of thinking.\n\nZionism is simply the belief that the jews, like any other group, should have a homeland. It doesnt mean you support Netanyahu, or even the war in Gaza. It simply means Israel should exist.\n\nIf Palestinains truly want a country they have to come to grips with the fact that it will beside Israel, not in place of it. Unfortunately, this seems unlikely given the rhetoric one often sees online and from the pro-palestinan movement. It's why many pro-palestinian folks who argue for immediate ceasefire get oddly silent when you point out that a ceasefire by definition is temporary and that maybe a permanent ceasefire (which is a peace treaty and acknowledgement of Israel) is what really needs to happen.",

If we express outrage after witnessing a year of brutal violence and daily killings in Gaza and Lebanon and say, \u201cFuck Zionism,\u201d is that instantly interpreted as hatred toward all Jews? This is a legit question im trying to ask\n\nFraming things this way serves the interests of the Israeli state, reducing every critique of its actions to antisemitism.\n\nWe recognize that many Jews do not align with the genocidal actions of Netanyahu\u2019s regime. Those who stand against this oppression and long-standing, institutionalized hatred should be protected and celebrated for their courage. \n\nLet\u2019s not forget that the real cause of the rise in unjustified antisemitism is the Israeli regime itself, committing atrocity after atrocity, and parading its violence through images of corpses, hostages, and devastated cities.\n\nI have many amazing Jewish friends who are just as horrified by these atrocities as I am, and it pains me that the actions of their \u201ccountry\u201d have made them feel unsafe everywhere. \n\n I\u2019ve been a long-time viewer of Ethan, Hila, and the crew, and I know Ethan isn\u2019t a Zionist.

He returned to find them all torn up on his desk this week on Monday. This was done by my school district\u2019s administrators. A new policy was recently implemented into my school district saying that teachers cannot express their political beliefs or opinions, or display anything in their rooms not relating to \u201cdesignated curriculum\u201d. The freshman social studies classes last year were shut down because the teachers referred to the genocide as a genocide. A handful of parents of students at my school were outraged, and claimed my school was teaching \u201cantisemitic lessons\u201d and \u201cpromoting hate against Jews\u201d by saying Israel is committing a genocide. Those lessons were promptly shut down. I\u2019m at the start of my junior year right now, and it\u2019s just terrifying to me that even something as familiar as my *school* is being controlled by ruthless zionists. I\u2019m gonna keep proudly wearing my Free Palestine shirt to school, and if anyone gets after me for it, I\u2019ll be happy to add their names to the list of pro-genocide racists. \n\nFrom the river to the sea \u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8\u2764\ufe0f",

There are a ton of right wingers now-a-days who have absolutely no context as to the dogwhistle of that word, and just think that it's a vague value set, as opposed to just being a Jew. The problem stems from the fact that, like the right, the left finds bedfellows with people who absolutely do know the context, and mean it in an antisemitic way, and it guides them down a path that is just terrible morally and optically. It doesn't help that Zionism, which could be broadly defined to include anyone who thinks Israel shouldn't be abolished as a state, to literally being West Bank Gvir-adjacent settlers. It's also at that crossroads of being ethnic group and western colonialism associated. Often the left is so anti-western imperialism, that they can't tell that the people around them (like a fair portion of the Arab world), totally is on board with the other part  too. In the end, if the effect ends up the same, idk if it really matters as a distinction. Apologies for the rant, I'm usually skeptical of Israel and the antisemite defense thrown out whenever the IDF faces criticism, but honestly seeing Ethan Klein's treatment by his fans has black pilled me into thinking this is going to only get worse.

It's not a means of waving away Netanyahu's right-wing insanity or the Occupation. It doesn't mean letting extremism run rampant at the expense of a true Israeli-Palestinian peace. For most American Jews, we believe Israel should exist and defend itself, but it is not above hostile criticism. And trust me, no one is better or more insistent on critiquing itself to no end than Jewish people. \n\nI see this the same way Americans believe in the founding father's supposed democratic ideals while acknowledging we haven't lived up to them over the centuries, from killing Native Americans to slavery and Jim Crow. The only way to peace is to acknowledge past sins while finding ways to overcome them. So saying Israel's treatment of the Palestinians must be different, especially post-Gaza war, is important. But by making anti-zionism a core part of their agenda, the protesters are viewing the extremist perspective as the only version of zionism that existed ever, despite history showing otherwise. Hell the Jewish people that started post-WWII human rights groups were zionists, so the motives seem contradictory. I often struggle to understand why the protesters can't see that when, if they just discussed common concerns between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian groups, we'd be a much stronger alliance in the realm of bringing peace. Right now, it feels like the students are calling for vengeance more than peace.",

The UK has been our home for 14 years and the question that is on my mind is it this a safe place for us to stay given the direction an increasingly aggressive rhetoric is heading?\n\nSince October 7^(th) there the debate around rising anti-Semitism has increased to the point that it is sometimes very difficult to differentiate between real anti-Semitism and valid criticism of Israel. I hate the way the word \u2018anti-Semitic\u2019 is being weaponized by some to silence legitimate debate. It waters the real issues down and makes it difficult to identify an actual worrying trend that I would like to dissect here.\n\nMy grandfather\u2019s entire family was wiped out by the Holocaust so that anxiety very much lives within my family although that type of antisemitism is much easier to identify. Coming from an extreme right ideology of racial purity, that angst is currently aimed at immigrants but no one in the Jewish community doubts it can return to target them at any given moment.\n\nIn the left, anti-Semitism has been more difficult to distinguish.\u00a0 What has once been a critical (sometimes legitimate) stance on Israel has been replaced with the question if Israel should have a right to exist altogether. A sea of signs with slogan such as\u00a0 \u201c RESIST EXIST RETURN \u2018 or \u2018FROM THE RIVER TO THE SEA.. \u2019 are common on London streets. The message here is clear that Israel as Jewish state cannot be allowed to stand amongst other countries as it was born out of sin.\n\nBut what was this original sin ? The \u2018Nakba\u2019 as it is still called. The accepted narrative reads something like:\u00a0 The colonial Zionists came on their boats from Europe and stole the land from the helpless Palestinians. Because it was stolen, there will only be justice when the land returns to its rightful owners.\u00a0\n\nWhile understandable why this narrative would appeal to the progressive left, if you study at the facts on the ground in the context of broader history a different story emerges.\n\nIf you look at the wider picture, the entire world at the time as in a process of moving from a one divided by great empires to one of nation states.\u00a0 Most of these nations were being born out of the remains of collapsing empires following two world wars. In this case we have the Ottomans, the last great Muslim Imperial dynasty where many ethnic minority groups existed with distinct identities such as, Kurds , Armenians , Greek orthodox and yes, Jews as well.\n\nIf we look purely on demographics, the Jews did deserve their share of the land following the Ottoman collapse in WW1. In 1914, they were approximately 1% of the population throughout the Ottoman lands, and this is without including anyone that was yet to come from Europe. \u00a0The total area of mandatory Palestine was also approximately 1% of the total area of the Ottoman Empire in 1914. \u00a0So evidently, the Balfour Declaration of 1917 got it right in parcelling a proportional amount of land for a Jewish state. The Europeans Jews that subsequently arrived during the British Mandate were not colonizers but persecuted refugees fleeing to the only place that would take them. One that they believed that was promised to them as a homeland.\n\nJust for context, other ethnic groups under Ottoman rule also fought for self-determination such as those in Muslim occupied Europe, the Greeks, Serbs and Bulgarians manged to gain statehood in the Balkan wars. The total number of Muslim refugees in these wars is estimated to be\u00a0between 400,000 and 813,000. The death toll is estimated to be between 632,000 and 1,500,000 Muslim civilians that were killed in a series of massacres.\n\nNation building is often violent, bloody and involves massive migration of ethnic groups that find themselves on the wrong side of the new border. But once those nations are born, bloody and painful as that birth might be, they focus their attention on building constructive future. \u00a0No one is calling that Greece shouldn\u2019t be allowed to exist even if their atrocities against Muslim civilians greatly outdo those in the 1948 \u2018Nakaba\u2019. No one is calling Greece an Ethno- nationalist state even when the Greek Orthodoxy is the official state religion as well as having a cross on their flag. No one in the West is calling for a right of return of Muslim refugees to Greece. Why should the position of Israel be different?\n\nIf the UN itself has voted in favour of a Jewish state, the world at the time was in agreement that Zionism was a legitimate movement. It is true that a horrendous war resulted with atrocities on both sides but ultimately, the Zionists had a mandate to declare a state and fight for its survival against overwhelming odds.\n\nIf Zionism is simply the belief in the right for the Jewish people to have a state regardless of prescribing specific boundaries, why is it become such a negative idea today? This is bewildering to me as If you are a left-wing progressive why on earth wouldn\u2019t you support the creation of a state for one of the most victimized and oppressed people in the history of humanity?\n\nThroughout most of History Jews were classed as downtrodden second class citizens and even when officially tolerated (ie not kicked out or massacred) they were generally not allowed to own land and that is why they often became traders and bankers. In Islamic lands they were also categorized as second classed \u2018dhimmi\u2019 that had to wear distinctive clothing and pay a substantial poll tax and a land tax.That is why the Islamic fundamentalists would never accept the humiliation of a Jewish state stubbornly existing in the heart of their old Islamic empire. \u00a0They have made this position very clear.\n\nThe question is that why would the progressive left align to this ideology and accept the existence of any state regardless of how it was formed except a Jewish one? I would argue that Palestinians deserve self-determination just like anyone but why not Jews as well? What could be the origin of this anti-Jewish prejudice other than a form of anti-Semitism that has lay dormant in the West since the days of Shylock only to reemerge now?\n\nI would venture on a limb and say that my working theory here is that the image a Jew standing up tall and having actual power and agency over their future is probably a tough concept for many progressives to swallow, including many Jews in the diaspora. A Jew isn\u2019t supposed to fight back when attacked, they are supposed to cower, flee and then hide in the nearest Deli to write some witty observation.\n\nAnti-Zionism seems to prescribe to this sentiment but happy to hear some alternate perspectives.",

With the campus protests starting again, both sides seem to purposely create misunderstandings to escalate the situation rather than focusing on what will most effectively achieve their end goal. Protestors say they are against \"Zionism,\" but some people hear that as being against the security of Israelis and for Hamas, which they then call out as antisemitic--a term that shuts down any possibility of discussion. But what it seems like protestors want is security for Gaza and the West Bank, a demand which shouldn't be considered antisemitic.\n\nIt seems they are seeing a lot of TikTok content that defines Zionism as wanting to expand Israel into Gaza and the West Bank. I've heard similar disagreement about \"From the river to the sea.\"\n\nAnd then I hear anti-protestors pointedly ignoring the protestors' concerns about the security of Palestinians while calling the protests antisemitic because they hear terms like anti-zionist and point to actions by a small minority of protestors.\n\nWouldn't it be more effective for the protestors' goals if they avoided the term Zionism or similar terms that aren't mutually defined and instead kept the message clear that they want Israel to stop harming civilians in Gaza and the West Bank?",

I know that the \u201cas few Arabs as possible\u201d line is the most striking, but I want to point out some of the subtler aspects. \n\nFor example, the 2023 and 2024 versions are obviously using Palestine in the \u201cregion\u201d sense as opposed to the \u201ccountry\u201d sense, and yet the more recent revisions seem to privilege it as being somehow the real name that \u201ccorresponds\u201d to Eretz Yisrael, whereas earlier revisions provided multiple names for the region all on equal footing, using the word \u201ccorrespond\u201d not between different names, but merely between the land and the list of names. Whereas previously it was the land that some people call Israel and some people call Palestine, which I think is a fairly fair and neutral description, now it is Palestine, which some people call Israel. \n\nThe insertion of the prefix *ethno-* is certainly notable as it supports claims that Zionism is based on racism. This is the kind of thing that I am talking about when I say that it seems like the trend here is to include anything that reads unsympathetically, even if in isolation it could be argued to be justified. After all, Judaism is partially an ethnicity, one might argue. And they \u201cbalanced\u201d it by including \u201ccultural\u201d to cover the non-ethnic component. And yet, the net result is definitely still negative. \n\nFinally, one change that strikes me as the most massive is the addition of the section about wanting to colonize pretty much any land outside of Europe, with it coming across like the choice of Israel/Palestine/Canaan/whatever was a mere afterthought. Yes, it is historically true that there were proposals for a Jewish state elsewhere, but they did not last very long or gain much traction, historically. Absolutely, the article should mention that kind of thing somewhere, but to put it in the very first sentence given its limited relevance to the concept of Zionism in broad strokes, especially as Zionism as it is thought of today, strikes me as an attempt to poison the well by defining Zionism as being about Europe versus the rest of the world. \n\nI get that many people might be tempted to shrug all of this off and say \u201cWikipedia is unreliable, what can you do?\u201d But regardless of how much one might individually respect Wikipedia, it is one of the largest influences on public thought in modern times. It shapes and moulds the impressions of billions of people around the world, both directly and indirectly. Things said on Wikipedia regularly make their way into the news and even sometimes academic writing. It is absolutely not something to shrug off as unimportant, and its importance will not go away anytime soon. \n\nDoes anyone, particularly those with experience with Wikipedia culture and edit wars, have any ideas about how to work collectively to counteract this?",

If you're passing through Beit Jala, a stop at Al Makhrour is a must,\" a comment from 2015 reads on its Facebook page.\n\nRamzi Kisiya who had inherited the land opened a restaurant in 2001 there with his wife and their four children. For years, hundreds of tourists passing through Bethlehem stopped there for a salad before continuing their hike in the green valleys.\n\nFor a long time, the Makhrour valley was untouched by uncontrolled Israeli settlements, but the trouble began in 2012 when an Israeli outpost a settlement not authorised by the government - was built there.\n\nThe settlers demolished the restaurant, claiming it belonged to the JNF. The Kisiya family, who insist otherwise, rebuilt their restaurant before it was demolished again in 2013 and then again in 2015. In 2019 the family decided to take the case to court to have their rights heard. But in 2023, a civil court in Jerusalem validated the expropriation.\n\nIn a bid to prevent the family's restaurant from being rebuilt again, the Israeli army declared the site to be a \"closed military zone\", which prevented anyone from entering it until this nast summer when Israeli\nsettlers backed by soldiers destroyed it once again.\n\nIsraeli settlers backed by the army seized the 5,000 square-metre plot on July 31 and evicted the French-Palestinian family. \"We are being targeted because we reject the government's Zionist policy,\" said Michelle Kisiya.\n\nExpulsions of Palestinians from their land in West Bank have increased, particularly since Israel's far-right government came to power in 2022. The situation has sharply deteriorated since Israel's invasion of Gaza last year.\n\nSupport the families of Al Makhrour at @savealmakhrour",

It seems to me that this concept - or rather this word - seems to be one of the major points of contention and misunderstanding because it seems to mean very different things depending on who you ask.\n\nMe myself as a British Jew, my grandparents would most certainly call themselves Zionists, to them this simply meant the belief that a Jewish state is a necessity in order to prevent another holocaust (they were of the generation who grew up during and after the holocaust so naturally their outlook was shaped by that). My granddad in particular was a dedicated Zionist and owned Herzl's books though he apparently simply liked living in London too much to ever consider moving to Israel, like other members of his family did.\n\nI would not describe him or most other older Jews who describe themselves as Zionists as hateful people, not even towards Palestinians. Although attacks by Palestinian groups on Israelis and diaspora Jews did upset them very much and they would be angry towards specific groups like Hamas - but I never remember them having any actual hatred towards Palestinians or Muslims themselves and living in London they interacted and talked with Muslims with no problem at all. If they were guilty of anything it was ignorance of the impact that the creation of Israel had had on the Palestinians which I think if they truly understood would probably have a more nuanced view on why the conflict was happening.\n\nI am aware there are people in the Jewish community who are just hateful to Muslims and Palestinians, but I wouldn't count my grandparents as such, in their case their Zionism did not mean being hateful to anyone. They did not seem to be a fan of the more right wing and fanatical form of Zionism which characterises Israeli politics today and thought it was ''a group of stupid people with war fantasies''.\n\nHowever, when I see the word Zionism used nowadays online or by pro-palestine protesters, Im not sure what they mean when they say it or what they have in mind. Zionism to them seems to mean a form of racism or some sort of Jewish supremacy which implies hatred and a desire to hurt or kill Palestinians or other groups- I don't fault people for thinking this but it doesn't really apply to my grandparents or most other Jewish people I've known who would call themselves 'zionist' and I don't really believe they deserve to be hated.\n\nSometimes when people use the word 'zionism' it does just confuse me a lot, my main worry concerning this is that people's vague definitions of Zionism are being confused with things which are just ordinary Jewish things like saying ''next year in Jerusalem'' or visiting the Western Wall or even observing Hannukah. To me this is where anti-zionism becomes anti-semitism but I dont think everyone who says such things are doing so out of a genuine hatred of Jews but out of misunderstanding.\n\nSo I would just like to ask, what does 'Zionism' mean to you? What is it you are describing when you say 'Zionism' and how would you define it?",

This is your chance to get out!\". Luckily, no Zionists were found, the car signed a sigh of relief, the implied lynching was averted.\n\nMy first reaction is, of course, emotional. Gangs of angry, young people, raiding a public space to intimidate Jews, as part of a nation-wide hysteria, supported by intellectuals, journalists and even the occasional politician - this could be everywhere from 1900's Moldova, 1940's Iraq, 1960's Libya. If I were there, would I stand up to them? Volunteer for whatever they planned to do if they found a Zionist? I come from a long line of Jews that made the opposite choice, over and over, and lived to tell the tale. It's not in my blood.\n\nBut then, there's a second, more rational thought. These keffiyeh-clad pogromchiks should be the ones raising their hands. They're probably the most active Zionists on that train, possibly some of the most active Zionists in the city. An actual Israeli IDF soldier on leave, the head of the World Zionist Congress, even the actual PM of Israel, wouldn't do as much for the Zionist cause as they did. An Israeli who wants to leave Israel, would see this video, and might reconsider. An Israeli who did what the Anti-Zionists demand, and already moved out of the Zionist Entity, might consider moving back. A mainstream American Zionist Jew might consider, for the first time ever, to move to Israel. A non-Zionist Jew, who believed that Zionism was unnecessary, might reconsider that belief.\n\nI get that this isn't a groundbreaking thought. Everyone who knows anything about Jewish history, knows that this is a pattern that was repeated across dozens of countries, throughout the 20th century. The moment a country becomes institutionally anti-Zionist, the Jews flee to Israel, realize Zionists were right all along, and make the Zionist project stronger. Israel would probably be destroyed several times over if not for anti-Zionists in the Arab world and Iran. Israel would never become the \"startup nation\", if not for the anti-Zionists in the Soviet Union and the rest of the Soviet bloc. Even if we agree that anti-Zionism has absolutely nothing to do with antisemitism, it's objectively the second-greatest cause for the persecution of Jews, destruction of Jewish communities, and yes, the strengthening of Zionism as an ideology, and Israel as a Zionist state, right after racial antisemitism.\n\nAnd indeed, you can fundamentally *ignore antisemitism exists at all*, and the point will still stand. According to various opinion polls, somewhere between 70% and 95% of American Jews are Zionists. As well as essentially all non-Ultra-Orthodox Jews in Israel. Even if we completely ignored antisemitism, the Anti-Zionists are still calling for millions of largely well-off, educated Zionist Jews to immigrate to Israel. Immediately making it wealthier, more educated, and with a firm Jewish majority between the river and the sea. While calling the Zionist middle-class Israelis to return, and preventing other mobile, Zionist middle-class Israelis to leave Israel to begin with. Needless to say, the existence of millions of Zionist evangelicals doesn't really change that point either, in either direction.\n\nIf the Anti-Zionists wanted to actually promote the Anti-Zionist goal of the Jews moving out of Israel, and not into it, they would go out of their way to be the most welcoming to Zionists - not just Jews. And the most welcoming of all to Israelis, and IDF soldiers. Those are the people they want to leave the most, after all! And yet, I've never seen any Anti-Zionists actually act in that way. I've seen them act exclusively in the opposite way. And achieve the exact opposite of Anti-Zionist goals.\n\nWhat I wonder, is whether the anti-Zionists on that subway train, on college campuses, on the massive marches in the streets, are unaware of that point. These clearly aren't very deep thinkers, so it's possible they simply didn't get that by chasing the Zionists away from America, they're driving them into Israel. Maybe they actually believe their own propaganda, and assume Zionists are just a tiny minority of far-right rabble-rousers, rather than the vast majority of American Jews. And if they get rid of the Zionist, they might be able to \"save\" the Jew.\n\nOr maybe, they're fully aware that what they're achieving here is Zionism, not anti-Zionism. Just like the admissions committees in Soviet universities who didn't accept Jews for \"anti-Zionist\" reasons, didn't particularily mind that those scientifically and technically-minded Jews would flee to Israel at the first chance they get, and play a crucial part in its high-tech industry. Just like the vast majority of Arab anti-Zionists today, don't regret the policies of their anti-Zionist grandparents. Even though the grandchildren of the Jews they drove out of their countries, are currently fighting the Palestinians in Gaza. Maybe they even believe that their anti-Zionism is not the same as antisemitism. It just happens to reach the same conclusion.",

Yet, as absurd it is, considering India's history of anti-colonial struggle, it is also based on misinformation. One of such misinformation is that Mahatma Gandhi wanted the Jews to let themselves be killed by Hitler. Amusingly, many have accused Mahatma Gandhi to be an anti-Semite. Yet, this propaganda is not just untrue, but opposite of what he said.\n\nGandhiji wrote about the persecution of Jews by Nazis in 1938, at the time when the leaders of Europe and America were happy to endorse and support Hitler. He expressed his sympathies with the Jewish people, and calls the persecution of Jews by the Nazis unparalleled in history. He says, \u201cIf there ever could be a justifiable war in the name of and for humanity, a war against Germany to prevent the wanton persecution of a whole race, would be completely justified.\u201d\n\nGandhiji was a believer in the idea of non-violence and satyagraha. He calls upon the Jewish people to resist and fight against the oppression. He says, \u201cIf I were a Jew and were born in Germany and earned my livelihood there, I would claim Germany as my home even as the tallest gentile German might, and challenge him to shoot me or cast me in the dungeon; I would refuse to be expelled or to submit to discriminating treatment.\u201d\n\n> The Nazi press assaulted Gandhi savagely for these words. It threatened reprisals against India. 'I should rank myself a coward,' he replied, 'if for fear of my country or myself or Indo-German relations being harmed I hesitated to give what I felt in the innermost recesses of my heart to be one hundred per cent sound advice.'\n\n> Jewish Frontier, a New York magazine, ridiculed Gandhi's proposal in March 1939, and sent him a copy. He quoted at length from the attack. 'I did not entertain the hope... that the Jews would be at once converted to my view.' Gandhi replied. 'I should have been satisfied if even one Jew had been fully convinced and converted... It is highly probable that, as the (Jewish Frontier) writer says, \"A Jewish Gandhi in Germany, should one arise, could function for about five minutes and would be promptly taken to the guillotine.\" But that does not disprove my case or shake my belief in the efficacy of non-violence. I can conceive the necessity of the immolation of hundreds, if not thousands, to appease the hunger of dictators.... Sufferers need not see the result during their lifetime... The method of violence gives no greater guarantee than that of non-violence...' Millions sacrifice themselves in war without any guarantee that the world will be better as a result or even that the enemy will be defeated. Yet who does not fiercely resent the suggestion that anybody should die in deliberate non-violent sacrifice?\n\nGandhiji likened the discrimination against Jewish people to the untouchability in India. He says that the entire world is the homeland for the Jews, but refuses to endorse the colonial programme of Zionism. He says, \u201cif they [the Jews] must look to the Palestine of geography as their national home, it is wrong to enter it under the shadow of the British gun. A religious act cannot be performed with the aid of the bayonet or the bomb.\u201d \n\nGandhiji wrote, \"Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French. It is wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs. What is going on in Palestine today cannot be justified by any moral code of conduct. The mandates have no sanction but that of the last war.\"\n\nGandhiji refused to support an ethno-religious state of Israel,\n\n> The cry for the national home for the Jews does not make much appeal to me. The sanction for it is sought in the Bible and the tenacity with which the Jews have hankered after return to Palestine.\n\n> Why should they not, like other peoples of the earth, make that country their home where they are born and where they earn their livelihood?... The nobler course would be to insist on a just treatment of the Jews wherever they are born and bred. The Jews born in France are French in precisely the same sense that Christians born in France are French.\n\nGandhiji was opposed to war and violence. One can say that his belief was idealistic, or even flawed. But to claim that he was against the Jews is absurd.\n\nToday, the Zionists' oppression and violence against Palestinian Arabs bears stark resemblance to the Nazi's treatment of Jews. The ethnic cleansing of Palestinians to establish Israel, emanates from a similar ideology as Lebensraum. Yet, this fascist violence is backed by the powers of the West, who claim to be the torch-bearers of democracy and peace.\n\nUN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has rightly described this ongoing conflict as a \u201ccrisis of humanity,\u201d and Gaza as a \u201cgraveyard for children.\u201d The Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories in the West Bank and Gaza is the longest military occupation in history since The Hague Convention of 1907 and a \u201cflagrant violation of international law\u201d.\n\nAt the same time, Modi Government's refusal to vote for UNHCR resolution condemning the Israeli occupation of Gaza has brought a shame to the entire nation. We must stand together in condemnation of Israeli brutality in Gaza. India, which has a history of anti-colonial struggle, and has advocated for world peace, must refuse to endorse Israeli war crimes.\n\nNote: This article was first published in November 2023.",

            "body": "Yes. Anti-Zionism is Anti-Semitism. And insisting on calling your opinion by that name is also.\n\nI've been trying to get to why the term \"Anti-Zionist\" annoys me so much. It annoys me more than Anti-Israeli, Anti-Semitic, Pro-Palestinian, Pro-Whatever. For that we will first need to cover some definitions:\n\n# Zionism\n\n>**Zionism**, Jewish\u00a0nationalist movement\u00a0that has had as its goal the creation and support of a Jewish national state in\u00a0Palestine, the ancient homeland of the\u00a0Jews\u00a0(Hebrew: Eretz Yisra\u02beel, \u201cthe Land of Israel\u201d).\n\n>*(Encyclopedia Britannica)*\n\nAs you can see, Zionism is a national movement, and its goal can be summarized in the phrase \"Jewish Self-Determination\".\n\n# Anti-Semitism\n\n>**Anti-Semitism**, \\[\u2026\\] hostility toward or\u00a0discrimination\u00a0against Jews as a religious or\u00a0racial group.\n\n>*(Encyclopedia Britannica)*\n\nAnti-Semitism is the hostility for anything Jewish, be it from the ethnic group sense of it, or the religion.\n\n# Self-Determination (Political Philosophy)\n\n>**Self-determination**, the process by which a group of people, usually possessing a certain degree of national\u00a0consciousness, form their own\u00a0state\u00a0and choose their own\u00a0government.\n\n>*(Encyclopedia Britannica)*\n\n# The Right to Self-Determination\n\nFrom the UN Charter (Chapter I, Article 1 (2)):\n\n>Article 1 (2) establishes that one of the main purposes of the United Nations, and thus the Security Council, is to develop friendly international relations based on respect for the \u201cprinciple of equal rights and self-determination of peoples\u201d. The case studies in this section cover instances where the Security Council has discussed situations with a bearing on the principle of self-determination and the right of peoples to decide their own government, which may relate to the questions of independence, autonomy, referenda, elections, and the legitimacy of governments.\n\n# Where am I going with this?\n\nBasically, one of the immutable rights of every ethnic group as described by the UN charter and for which I believe most of the (at-least western) world adheres is the right to choose their own government to manage them in their lands. Zionism is the Jewish form of the aspiration to self determination (once again, immutable right). Which means every person that purports themselves to be advocating against oppression of ethnic groups should be in favor of this idea \u2013 it's right there in the definition.\n\nThe given conclusion is that being Anti-Zionist \u2013 meaning, against the concept of Zionism, is to be against the right of self-determination of Jews. Now, by itself, this does not necessarily mean one is racist for holding this opinion. But it depends on this opinion being the same for all other ethnic groups, otherwise, one is signaling out an ethnic group for a hostile opinion, which is racism, which in the context of Jews, is called Anti-Semitism.\n\nAs an aside, if you believe no ethnic group should have self-determination, I don\u2019t think we have anything to discuss in this sub-reddit, which is literally about the ethnic self-determination of two groups.\n\nMany of the Palestine supporters in the west proud themselves in being \"Anti-Zionist\". Now, there are three options here:\n\n1. They are, and they understand what it means, which means they are antisemitic.\n2. They do not understand the definition of Zionism (A very misfortunate instance of ignorance which should be stamped out).\n\nWhen pressed about this subject, most of my interactions with those people concluded in them saying something among the lines of \"I support self-determination, but not in the expanse of Palestinians\". But once again, the definition of Zionism does not exclude Palestinian Self-Determination from happening. So, when pressed again, I usually get the answer \"Well, I am not really Anti-Zionist, just Anti-Israeli or their government\".\n\nThis is where I get annoyed at them. Why do they insist on calling themselves Anti-Zionist? They are literally calling themselves racists which is a thing most of those people are reportedly disgusted of. This leads me to the crux if the issue.\n\nThe term \"Zionism\" was co-opted by the pro-Palestine movement in order to generate negative opinion on Jews where they are, in order to incite populist support for their cause. **By slowly changing the working definition of Zionism in the minds of the populace, the movement has managed to make them view anyone who identifies as a Zionist as racist bigot** (Once again, those descriptors might be true for some people, but there is no correlation between them, as shown in the definitions sections).\n\nYet most jews, and definitely most Israelis will call themselves Zionists without even thinking, to them, there is nothing wrong with the term. This makes them the target of slurs, attacks, and accusations by the populist mob-mentality, **thus the seed of the thought \"All Jews are racist bigots\" is planted in the mind of the populace**, Zionism becomes a word akin to \"Nazism\" \u2013 the ultimate evil, and all that without any connection to any definition. But that is the literal idea of a prejudice \u2013 an opinion that is flawed, hostile towards a group, and yet is completely based in nothing but fairy tales. This leads me to believe that by insisting on calling yourself \"Anti-Zionist\" you are promoting Anti-Semitic thoughts, opinions, and words of all, actions. And by continuing to call yourself by that word, you bring us back to the world of the 1930's, the exact world where Zionism got its biggest leap in support in the Jewish population world-wide, mostly for being one of the worst times to be a Jew in Europe.\n\nPlease stop \u2013 the only change you make by using that name is one that entrenches the conflict even further without any foreseeable solution, because the demonization of Zionism makes the Palestinian populace fall victim to it as well, making them more extreme in their resistance to Israeli occupation, which results in acts of terror, which results in Israel cracking down on them, because the whole point of Israel is to defend the Jewish ethnic group. You are making Jewish & Palestinian lives worse, for the sake of your false sense of moral superiority. Please Stop.\n\nEDIT: For crying out loud, I even bolded the essence of my argument.",

Just as a Jew eating a cheeseburger doesn\u2019t make the cheeseburger kosher, a Jew who rejects a Jewish state in Israel does not change Judaism. \n\nHere are a few examples of normative, text based Judaism- from Liturgy, Tanach & Toshba.\n\nThe Shema:  the foundational prayer that proclaims Hashem\u2019s oneness.  The second paragraph concludes:  \u201cAnd you shall inscribe them (words of Torah) on the doorposts of your house and on your gates - so that your days and the days of your children may be prolonged on the land which the L-rd swore to your fathers to give to them for as long as the heavens are above the earth.\u201d\n\nThe Amidah: 19 prayers that form the climax of the 3 daily services (4 on Shabbat and holidays):\n\n\u201cSound the great shofar for our freedom; raise a banner to gather our exiles, and bring us together from the four corners of the earth into our land. Blessed are You L-rd, who gathers the dispersed of His people Israel.\u201d\n\n\u201cReturn in mercy to Jerusalem Your city and dwell therein as You have promised; speedily establish therein the throne of David Your servant, and rebuild it, soon in our days, as an everlasting edifice. Blessed are You L-rd, who rebuilds Jerusalem.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay our eyes behold Your return to Zion in mercy. Blessed are You L-rd, who restores His Divine Presence to Zion.\u201d\n\nBirkat Hamazon (Grace after meals) begins with Psalm 126:  \n\n\u201cWhen God restored the exiles to Zion it seemed like a dream. Our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with joyful song.\u201d\n\nTanach: \n\nThee very first thing that God said to Abraham was: \"Go from your land of your birth\u2026 to the land that I will show you, and I will make you into a great nation\" (Genesis 12:1). When Abraham and Sarah got to Israel, God promised them, \"To your descendants have I given this land from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates River.\" In God's eyes the deal was considered set in stone, which is why He said \"I have given this land\" in the past tense, as if the thing were already done and impossible to undo. (Genesis 15:18, Rashi)\n\nAbraham paid exorbitant amounts for a field in Hebron (Genesis 23:4, Rashi). This became the Jewish holy site, the Tomb of the patriarchs, 4,000 years ago. Similarly, Jacob purchased Shechem (Genesis 33:19), and King David bought Jerusalem (2-Samuel 24:24)\n\n\nToshba (Orally transmitted commentary Torah): \n\n\u201cThe Holy One, blessed be he, further took the measure of all lands and found no land but the Land of Israel that was truly worthy for the people Israel\u201d (Leviticus Rabah 13:2).\n\n\u201cA person who walks 4 amot (about 7 feet) in Israel, it is assured to him that he is one deserving of the World to Come\" (Ketuvot 111a)\n\nThere are many more examples; this is only a starting point, please add to the list!\n\n\n\n",

In its most basic definition. \n\nSo what we typically don\u2019t go for now a days is atrocity in the name of religion. So slaughtering and displacing hundreds of thousands of Arabs obviously is horrible. They were so horribly brutal to the Arabs when Israel was \u201creclaimed\u201d. We know this for a fact. In that case I certainly am against Zionism, you don\u2019t have any right to your land from thousands of years ago because of a silly book, and yes I\u2019m against all atrocities in the name of religions from every religious text in the world from any religion lol. \n\nIf it was about having a Jewish nation, there were other places in the world that this was far more feasible (that were not in religious texts) It\u2019s interesting to condemn Palestine for their religious anti lgbt beliefs (which I do) but then not condemn the religious beliefs that state that you lay claim to land from thousands of years ago and can take it by force. \n\nSpeaking of lgbt rights, in say Palestine, it was decriminalized in 1950 or so in many areas. Obviously it\u2019s very taboo and in some places they\u2019ll just slaughter you. But of course they have been occupied by a military force and in some places live in an apartheid community, AND have been brutalized for years and years. We know this factually too. If you\u2019ve been occupied by another military force and you\u2019ve been being bombed and brutalized, which is clear before Hamas and even before hezbollah, you aren\u2019t instigating, you\u2019re fighting back.. It\u2019s obvious what the Israeli military force has been doing over the years, theres enough clear evidence, and clear video evidence, and it wasn\u2019t keeping \u201corder\u201d. \n\nObviously I condemn Hamas. We have all also seen the brutality of Hamas. And it\u2019s despicable. But this is just all hypocritical and in the end based in middle eastern racism or just ignorance. The two state solution was never really Israel\u2019s goal, their political leaders have been actually relatively transparent on this. \n\nI actually also have no doubt being gay would be illegal in America still if we were occupied by a huge military force in an open air prison. Of course when this is the case, historically, no real progress occurs within that society. Now I am asking this to gain insight not to instigate hate, regardless that I did use some intense words.

There are no differences between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. We are part of one people, the Arab nation. Lo and behold, I have relatives with Palestinian, Lebanese, Jordanian and Syrian citizenship. We are one people. It is only for political reasons that we carefully endorse our Palestinian identity. Indeed, it is of national interest for the Arabs to encourage the existence of the Palestinians in the face of Zionism. Yes, the existence of a separate Palestinian identity is only for tactical reasons. The establishment of a Palestinian state is a new means to continue the struggle against Israel and for Arab unity.\"\n\nI'm happy to be proved wrong if anyone can show me one Palestinian Zionist. Meanwhile there are tons of Jews who support a Palestinian state so it's quite one sided in terms of recognizing eachother's right to exist and self determine. I guess this is why unfortunately the only option for Israel to continue existing is occupation of the Arabs living in Gaza and the West Bank. It's better to be hated than dead!\n\nAnd if the occupation was so bad, why wouldn't these Arabs move to another Arab state? They will never be able to fulfill this AntiZionist fairytale of destroying Israel, so why not live in a place that already has Arab self determination like Syria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Qatar, Iran? How many more wars do they have to lose until they realize Israel will not allow the creation of a state whose goal would be to destroy Israel.",

For a few weeks after Oct 7th religious jews we're being beat up in my area. The irony is most of that sect of jews doesn't support Israel, but they get lynched anyway. \nWhy don't the speakers on the left take responsibility for the rhetoric and show the differences between anti semitism and zionism?

This has been backed up by practically all reputable studies and the only \"argument\" that people with the opposite opinion have is \"WELL THEY LOOK WHITE\". That in itself doesn't say much, phenotype is subjective and can change due to things like founder effects. It's a deeply childish and unscientific way to determine origin. The science has been clear for a while about a Levantine origin for most of the world's Jewish populations, including Ashkenazim.\n\nNone of that has very much bearing on whether or not what Israel is doing right now is good or whether the Zionist project was a good idea to implement. You could simply be stating it as a matter of fact as opposed to justifying Zionism but people will not care. They need the white colonizer narrative to be real because they want to think they're fighting the French in Algeria or the Dutch in South Africa. \n\nIt's also become fashionable for another reason-namely that there's the well-known meme of the white person in America claiming to be part native/Cherokee when they're not. They see Ashkenazi Jews as basically the Elizabeth Warrens of the Middle East. It's not surprising either that these ideas are being pushed almost entirely by people who live in the West.

I believe that antisemitism is a plague and that the only solution to antisemitism is Zionism. I believe that Jews must be protected and that Israel, the Jewish state, must therefore be protected.\n\nHowever, Zionism doesn\u2019t seem to be too popular on Reddit, and I\u2019ve had a few heated debates with self-proclaimed \u201canti-Zionists.\u201d Stranger yet, a few of the aforementioned \u201canti-Zionists\u201d are Jewish. The thing is, I don\u2019t understand why some Jews oppose Zionism, as the purpose of Zionism is to protect Jews. Before I go any further, I\u2019m going to define a few terms. You are free to disagree with my definitions.\n\nZionism: The belief that Jews deserve the right to self-determination in their ancestral homeland, the Land of Israel. It is inherently a secular political ideology as it seeks to create a nation-state for the Jewish people so that Jews can flee persecution in the diaspora. Thus, one could simply define Zionism as \u201cJewish nationalism.\u201d\n\nAnti-Zionism: Opposition to Zionism, the belief that Jews deserve the right to their own state in the Land of Israel. Anti-Zionists deny Jews the right to self-determination for many, often arbitrary, reasons. Anti-Zionists also frequently deny the Jews\u2019 strong historical and cultural connection to their ancestral homeland and the city of Jerusalem. Anti-Zionists may also deny or downplay persecution of Jews in order to prove why Jews do not deserve a state. For these reasons, many Jewish organizations argue that anti-Zionism is antisemitic, mostly because anti-Zionists believe that other peoples deserve their own state.\n\nAntisemitism: Hatred of or prejudice towards Jewish people. It is often considered the oldest form of hatred due to the Jews\u2019 millennia-long history of persecution. It manifests itself in myriad forms and has led to countless expulsions, numerous pogroms, and, most infamously, the Holocaust.\n\nCriticism of Israel: Criticism of Israeli politicians, the Israeli government, Israeli policies, etc. can all be considered criticism of Israel. Criticism of Israel is not inherently antisemitic, and many Jews in Israel are critical of their country.\n\nAnti-Israelism: Opposition to Israel\u2019s existence or Israel as a concept. Criticism of Israel becomes anti-Israelism when the critic unfairly holds Israel to a higher standard than other liberal Western democracies. Anti-Israelists may hold Israel to an impossible standard, arguing that Israel is bad because it is not perfect. Some anti-Israelists portray Israel as a uniquely evil state. Anti-Israelism is a form of anti-Zionism and is inherently antisemitic.\n\nNow that I have defined my terms, it is time for me to present my argument:\n\nI should begin by mentioning that anti-Zionist Jews are a token minority. 94 percent of Jews identify as Zionists, and 82 percent of American Jews consider Israel an \u201cimportant\u201d or \u201cessential\u201d part of their Jewish identity. In other words, the vast majority of Jews are Zionists. Despite - or, perhaps, because of - this, anti-Zionist Jews are usually very vocal about their belief that Zionism is a form of racist colonialism or oppression, even though Jews by definition cannot colonize their ancestral homeland. Anti-Zionist Jews seem hellbent on making it seem like anti-Zionism is a popular belief among Jews, even though polling suggests otherwise.\n\nI have noticed that there are two different types of anti-Zionist Jews, and, other than their opposition to Zionism, their views could not be more different. On the one hand, some Orthodox Jews oppose Zionism for theological reasons, as they believe that Jews cannot reclaim Israel until the Mashiach (Messiah) arrives. However, they are a minority within a minority. The vast majority of anti-Zionist Jews are self-proclaimed \u201cprogressives\u201d whose views often, ironically enough, align more closely with those of neo-Nazis and Islamists.\n\nJewish leftism is nothing new. For the most part, Jews have historically supported civil rights, and many Jews have been critical of capitalism. When it was founded, Israel was actually Soviet-aligned to an extent, though it eventually became a US ally. So, it seems only natural for Jews to support left-wing causes like anti-Zionism. The issue is, anti-Zionism is, if anything, regressive leftism, i.e. ostensibly left-wing ideas or policies that actually undo progress. The term \u201cregressive leftism\u201d has also been applied to some policies regarding race, with some critics arguing that things like \u201csafe spaces\u201d for certain races are just forms of racial segregation. As mentioned previously, the goal of Zionism is to solve antisemitism. After seeing the millennia of continued hatred of Jews, many Jews figured that the only solution was to create their own state, a safe haven for all the world\u2019s Jewry. Opposition to Zionism, therefore, means maintaining the status quo, even if the status quo is antisemitism. Of course, now that Jews have a state, anti-Zionism now frequently includes calls to destroy Israel and her people by extension, i.e. a second Holocaust. In this way, anti-Zionism is regressive.\n\nNow, why would any rational Jew support anti-Zionism? As mentioned, relatively few Jews do. However, for the Jews that do oppose Zionism, I believe that the main reason is privilege. Anti-Zionist Jews appear to overwhelmingly be American - which, considering the US has the largest Jewish population in the world, is not surprising, especially since >99 percent of Israeli Jews probably support Zionism. Unlike in other parts of the world, Jews have never really faced much legal discrimination in the US. Additionally, while most Jews who came to the US were impoverished, Jews today have the highest average wealth of any religious group in America. This is largely because Jews tend to be well-educated; Jews have the highest voter turnout of any religious group for the same reason. Most American Jews today have therefore lived alongside gentiles and thus probably don\u2019t think that antisemitism is still that huge of an issue. This mindset, however, is wrong.\n\nIn recent years, the number of antisemitic hate incidents has steadily increased. Even before the Oct. 7 massacre, more than half of all religious-based hate crimes were against Jews. Following the Hamas attack on Israel, the number of antisemitic incidents skyrocketed, and antisemitism became more and more explicit. In October, you mostly had innocuous-looking calls to \u201cFree Palestine.\u201d In April, you had protesters harassing Jews and preventing them from attending class. Now, Jews are getting stabbed in the streets. With each passing day, the world becomes more hostile to Jews. And yet, anti-Zionist Jews either don\u2019t seem to realize this or refuse to. Some outright say that the real antisemitism is assuming that all Jews support Israel (even though this is something that \u201canti-Zionists\u201d frequently do). Some even say that Islamophobia is a greater issue or that the Palestinians are the real victims of antisemitism. Of course, both claims are ludicrous.\n\nOne thing I can say is that support for Zionism appears to be rising worldwide. As antisemitism becomes a fact of life once again in Europe, many Jews are packing their bags. Antisemitism has also become commonplace in South Africa, and most South African Jews have had enough. Israel has been anticipating a postwar wave of Jewish migration for months now, and it\u2019s not hard to see why. As antisemitism becomes re-normalized, many Jews are realizing why Israel exists. Will the same happen to American Jews? Only time will tell.",

I believe it's more accurately described as a refugee movement, and here's why:\n\nZionism arose from the existential threats facing Jews, particularly in Europe, at the end of the 19th century. While the movement incorporated nationalist elements, influenced by the broader Spring of Nations, this aspect was secondary to its core purpose: creating a safe haven for persecuted Jews. The movement's initial focus on European immigration was driven by urgent humanitarian needs \u2013 Jews were seeking escape from discrimination, violence, and potential annihilation.\n\nThe selection of Palestine was partially due to historical Jewish connections, but pragmatically, it offered vast underdeveloped areas. While hundreds of thousands of locals did inhabit the region, early Jewish immigrants predominantly settled in sparsely populated areas or on legally acquired lands. This approach aimed to minimize conflict and establish new communities.\n\nCrucially, the Jewish migration to Palestine wasn't an immediate mass exodus. Most Jews in Europe still led relatively stable lives, especially when compared to the challenges in Palestine \u2013 disease (particularly malaria), poverty, and underdevelopment. The majority of Jewish emigrants actually chose the United States until 1924, when strict immigration quotas were imposed. This closure of America as a refuge option significantly impacted subsequent migration patterns. These facts undermine the notion that Zionism was primarily a nationalist movement, as some argue, rather than a quest for refuge.\n\nThe relatively small groups of Jewish immigrants to Palestine made substantial contributions to the region. They battled malaria by draining swamps, developed critical infrastructure benefiting all inhabitants, and some groups even engaged in resistance against British colonial rule. These actions demonstrate a commitment to improving the living conditions for all residents, not just Jewish settlers.\n\nThe real surge in Jewish immigration to Palestine began after 1924 and intensified after 1933 with the Nazis' rise to power. These weren't fervent nationalists, but desperate refugees fleeing for their lives, who didn't have a real alternative. They joined the fledgling national community established by earlier Zionist pioneers, driven by survival rather than ideology.\n\nI'm not here to assign blame for the subsequent conflicts between Jews and Arabs \u2013 both sides have their narratives. My central argument is that the majority of Jews in Israel are essentially involuntary refugees, not colonial settlers driven by imperialist ambitions. The rising rate of antisemitism in the world today only strengthens the feelings felt by the majority of the Jewish citizens of Israel - that they have no alternative even after 76 years.\n\nWhile the ongoing situation in the West Bank is complex and controversial, with valid concerns about settlement policies, this doesn't retroactively apply to the establishment of Israel proper. At its core, the history of Zionism is fundamentally rooted in the desperate need for refuge, not in colonialist aspirations.",

The video showcased houses and residential complexes in Berlin where Jewish people live. Stars of David were painted on the front doors, to signify to the public that Jewish people reside there. This harkening back to Nazi-era tactics of demarcating Jewish residences was due to the rising tensions between Israel and Palestine/Gaza. \n\nReasonable comments to this post would likely be something along the lines of \"This is horrible, Jewish civilians should not be targeted because of the actions of the Israeli government\". Instead, the comments with the highest amount of likes just called for the death of Zionists; keep in mind that this was in response to seeing Star's of David being painted on the front doors of Jewish civilians. The comment with the most amount of likes, at 81K, claims that it is \"Zionists\" that are faking these hate crimes, to make it look like they are being harassed.\n\nAt what point does the Pro-Palestinian crowd's claim of being anti-Zionism just turn into anti-Semitism? To me, if you're initial reaction to seeing these hate crimes is to immediately call for the deaths of Zionists (in this case, innocent Jewish Berliners), then I find it incredibly difficult to view the Pro-Palestinian movement as having nothing to do with anti-Semitism. I do believe that one could hold anti-Zionist views without being anti-Semitic, but it is high-engagement videos like this that make me believe that a sizeable amount of people (I'm unsure of the proportion) on the Pro-Palestinian side may not be capable of holding both views simultaneously. What are your thoughts on this? Is the line between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism blurring or is it something else?\n\nBelow are the screenshots of the initial post, and the comments with the highest engagement (likes).

            "body": "Let me first just say that I'm not overly educated on the long history between Israel and the surrounding arab states. But I was watching a debate yesterday about whether or not antizionism is the same as antisemitism. The propaganda from Douglas Murray was deplorable. Apparently the world is upset with Israel killing tens of thousands of innocent people because they hate Jews and not because they hate the killing of tens of thousands of innocent people. \n\nBut anyway, isn't zionism the belief that Jewish people have the right to their own ethno state? Technically the very concept of an ethno state is an inherently racist and discriminatory idea. Imagine any ethnic group on the planet saying they should have a state or country where only people like them are welcome. But it was argued during the debate that if you're against this idea, because you want a state where everyone is welcomed, you're the racist one - more specifically you're antisemitic. \n\nBut I don't get it, how is this not Jewish supremacy? If a non-Jewish white person says they want a white enthno state, we'd call them a white supremacist. But when a Jewish person says it, they're not a Jewish supremacist? I get there's a long history and all that but the debate didn't include any of that history in the definition of antizionism. In fact it makes even less sense because lots of people probably define zionism slightly differently. To say antizionism is automatically antisemetic without clearly establishing in what context means it applies in every context possible which simply amounts to censure and only allows for Jewish supremacist propaganda. How is that not inherently immoral?",

            "body": "I wanted to share some foundational texts and news articles written in the late nineteenth / early 20th centuries, which demonstrate how Zionism was uncontroversially understood as a colonial movement, both by its members and in general. I challenge anyone to explain why it seems like everyone, from its founders to its members to the press, since its founding up to the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948, all agreed that Zionism was a colonial movement and openly described it as such. \n\nI won't respond to any comments that are just whataboutism or don't respond directly to the content of the post. I also won't respond to any comments which make historical claims without backing them up with *primary* evidence like I did here.\n\nHere goes.\n\nFirst, foundational texts by the Zionists themselves:\n\n1. Der Judenstaat by Herzl (1896)\n\nThe first and possibly most important of the texts below. It is the founding text of Zionism. Everyone should read it. It lays out Zionism pretty succinctly. Herzl indisputably conceived of Zionism as a colonization project as well as being a national movement. Here, he's speaking about Palestine and Argentina, his two top picks for territory to colonize:\n\n>In both countries important experiments in colonization have been made, though on the mistaken principle of a gradual infiltration of Jews. An infiltration is bound to end badly. It continues till the inevitable moment when the native population feels itself threatened, and forces the government to stop a further influx of Jews. Immigration is consequently futile unless we have the sovereign right to continue such immigration\n\nNotice how he talks about the native populations. Who's he referring to here? Certainly not himself.\n\n2. [The Iron Wall by Jabotinsky (1923)](https://en.jabotinsky.org/media/9747/the-iron-wall.pdf)\n\n>The native populations, civilised or uncivilised, have always stubbornly resisted the colonists, irrespective of whether they were civilised or savage   \n  \nZionist colonisation must either stop, or else proceed regardless of the native population. Which means that it can proceed and develop only under the protection of a power that is independent of the native population\u2014behind an iron wall, which the native population cannot breach\n\nThis text is pretty explicit... not much to comment on. Again, talking about colonizers and a native population. Yet some Zionists today want to convince us that *they* are the natives of Palestine. Why didn't Jabotinsky consider himself native? I've never heard of a native people not knowing that they're the natives of their native land.\n\nA minor aside, but Jabotisnky was one of the founders of revisionist Zionism, the same ideology of Likud, the governing party of Israel today. It's important to realize that Israel hasn't concluded its colonization process yet. Its policies today are a direct continuation of these origins. Jabotinsky's 'iron wall' has turned into a literal massive wall today separating the populations.\n\n3. Chaim Weizmann, addressing the UN Special Committee (1947)\n\n>All of you will remember the East Indian Charter Company. But charter companies were hard to fashion in 1918, the first quarter of the twentieth  \ncentury. The Wilsonian conception of the world certainly would not have  \nallowed a charter company. Therefore, we had to create a substitute. This substitute was the Jewish Agency which had the function of a charter company, which had the function of a body which would conduct the\u00a0colonization, immigration, improvement of the land, and do all the work  \nwhich a government usually does, without really being a government.\n\nWeizmann was president of the World Zionist Organization and first president of Israel. On another occasion, he says\n\n>the native \\[Palestinian\\] population was akin to \u2018the rocks of Judea, as obstacles that had to be cleared on a difficult path\n\nAgain, the Palestinians are called the natives. Notice how late this text is -- it's in 1947! Right before the partition plan. Weizmann draws a direct parallel to the previous mechanisms of colonization through charter companies, and explains how difficult colonization was becoming this late in the 20th century. A lot of Zionists also use a weak semantic argument that \"colonization\" meant something different back then, or had an innocuous meaning. But it seems obvious here that he and all the prior texts are using colonization exactly like we understand it today, and exactly how every other European colonization happened lol. Notice also that he says \"colonization\" and \"immigration\" separately. They didn't think of them as the same thing.\n\nNext, some news articles from the same period:\n\n1. \"PLAN OF COLONIZING PALESTINE WITH JEWS; Zionists Discuss Problem in Big Chicago Meeting. Rabbi Emil G. Hirsch Says Government Established by Them There Would Be Model\" [(NYT - 1899)](https://www.nytimes.com/1902/01/06/archives/plan-of-colonizing-palestine-with-jews-zionists-discuss-problem-in.html)\n\nNothing new or surprising here. NYT is just reporting on a Zionist conference in Chicago. They were pretty explicit about their plan to colonize Palestine.\n\n2. \"Palestine Will Grow to Large Dominion Through Jewish Colonization, Says Sir Alfred Mond\" [(Jewish Daily Bulletin - 1926)](https://www.jta.org/archive/palestine-will-grow-to-large-dominion-through-jewish-colonization-sir-alfred-mond-tells-canada-zion)\n\nIn this article: \n\n>\\[...\\] the settling of Jews in Palestine will lead to the formation of another dominion in the British Empire like that of Canada.\n\n>\"Palestine and Canada are exactly alike\", the speaker said. The country is rich in agricultural value, but is faced with the same colonization problems\n\n>\\[Palestine\\] would be of inestimable value not only to Jewish but also the British Empire\n\n>he said loyalty to Britain was part of the creed of English Jews and the Jews intend to assist in the stabilization of the empire\n\nPalestine is just like Canada to the British Empire, according to an English Zionist in a speech delivered in 1926.\n\n3. \"Palestine Seen as Key to British Colonial Empire - Zionism Maintains Prestige of White Race in the East\" (Jewish Advocate - 1900)\n\n>In the sea of the native population of Arabia, the Palestinian Jews stand isolated, an outpost of Europe and, if rightly handled an element of strength of the empire\n\n>Palestine is an asset to the British Empire. It is the only example since the war of a successful European colonization on a large scale. Although the fact may not yet be recognized by all, the success of the Palestine enterprise is a success for Europe. It helps to maintain the prestige of the white race in the East\n\nPalestine wasn't thought of differently than any other British colonial outpost. It is just the last successful one. Note also how it's considered a European colonization, and even talks about the White Race! Yes, Ashkenazi Jews are Europeans, surprise surprise. \n\n4. \"Great Britain Offers Territory to the Zionists.\" [(NYT - 1903)](https://www.nytimes.com/1903/08/24/archives/jewish-state-for-jews-great-britain-offers-territory-to-the.html)\n\n>Dr. Herzl, in his opening address, referring to the collapse of the project to establish the Jews on the Sinal Peninsula, announced that Great Britain had offered the Zionists a large tract of territory in East Africa for colonization by the Jews, who would have an autonomous government under British suzerainty. The question of accepting the offer, he said, would be submitted to the congress.\n\nZionists didn't even necessarily want to colonize Palestine, they were open to colonizing the Sinai Peninsula or territory in East Africa -- any territory the British could afford to give them. Zionism was simultaneously a solution to the \"Jewish Problem\" in Europe but also an outpost of European imperialism in the early 20th century -- absolutely genius idea!\n\nAlso, notice how most of these texts even precede the British mandate. A lot of Zionists deny that Palestine existed before the British Mandate became a thing. \"It's just the Ottoman Empire!\" So what is everyone talking about here if Palestine didn't exist before then ???",

The reason is fairly simple, when contrasted to the success of Zionism.  \n  \nFrom its earliest days, Zionism focused on building and creating. It took what it could get and did with it what it could. It lobbied the powers that be to get scraps, then built a quasi state apparatus decades before it became a state. It had a purpose beyond grievance. Its goal (whatever you think of it) was to build a place of refuge for Jews. Fighting its enemies was a necessary byproduct of its success but never a primary goal.  \n  \nPalestinian nationalism has focused almost entirely on fighting Zionism, but it never built functioning government and civil institutions\u2014nor did it try very hard. Fighting Israel was how it defined itself. Building a state apparatus was secondary at best\u2014almost like that part was just a bother.  \n  \nYou can\u2019t build when your goal is only to tear down. You can\u2019t create a functioning independent state if that\u2019s not your aim. You \\*won\u2019t\\* succeed if your passion is not to provide for your population but only to destroy another.  \n  \nYou can globalize the intifada, whip up hatred of Israel and Israelis, spread violence across the world, celebrate your martyrs. But Palestinians will be no better off a century from now if their movement can only muster up rage but can\u2019t constructively envision success.\"",

There were different interpretations of what that meant, left wing, right wing, everything in between.\n\nThe state has been established. That's it. There is a country with nearly 10 million people, the majority of which were born there and have no other home. It has an education system, a government, a military, science and technology initiatives, an energy network, transportation, tourism, literature, music, cinema, architecture, museum, cuisine, sports. It is a country. It's that simple. Other countries have been formed via far worse cases of ethnic cleansing, genocide, or whatever other buzzword you want to use to simplify Israel's history. \n\nThe use of the term Zionism is a total dogwhistle meant to deny the right of Israel to exist by implying the movement to form it is still active, and thus you can oppose the right of Israel to be an actual country in the first place. You can call its citizens white settler colonists (without any knowledge of the demographics or history). You can call everyone in there a legitimate target for groups that fight against it. You can claim that being born in Israel makes you an evil ideologue, rather than a human being who grew up in a certain place. This language is used by the pro-Palestine movement's loudest spokespeople to literally refer to Jewish children and babies as \"settlers\" who deserved to die on Oct 7 by virtue of where they were born. With zero call-out by other members of the movement.\n\nThe use of the term \"Zionism\" is just a way to dehumanize Israelis and justify the concept that Israel needs to be destroyed. That's it. It serves literally no other purpose. ",

My experience in this sub has not been welcoming nor helpful.\n\n**ORIGINAL TEXT:** I don\u2019t involve myself much in politics, etc. so I\u2019ve been out of the loop when it comes to this conflict. People who are pro-Palestinian are often anti-Zionist, or that\u2019s at least what I\u2019ve noticed. Isn\u2019t Zionism literally just support for a Jewish state even existing? I understand the government of Israel is committing homicide. Why be anti-Zionist when you could just be against that one government? It does not make sense to me, considering that the Jewish people living in Israel outside of the government do not agree with the government\u2019s actions. What would be the problem with supporting the creation of a Jewish state that, you know, actually has a good government that respects other cultures? Why not just get rid of the current government and replace it with one like that? It seems sort of wrong to me and somewhat anti-Semitic to deny an ethnic group of a state. Again, it\u2019s not the people\u2019s fault. It\u2019s the government\u2019s. Why should the people have to take the fall for what the government is doing? I understand the trouble that the Palestinians are going through and I agree that the Israeli government is at fault. But is it really so bad that Jewish people aren\u2019t allowed to have their own state at all? I genuinely don\u2019t understand it. Is it not true that, if Palestinians had a state already which was separate from Israel, there would be no war necessary? Why do the Palestinians need to take all of Israel? Why not just divide the land evenly? I\u2019m just hoping someone here can help me understand and all.",

Why they thought it was a good idea to do this segment again is beyond me.\n\nIn the new segment, he asked the crew if they thought kids were having conversations about sex and a child called him a groomer for being there (since it was inappropriate to have a 40 year old man interacting with children in a children's game... and calling them \"hoes\").\n\nThe next week, Ethan admits his own employees (4 women) have been sexually assaulted by the talent he hires (Jimmie Lee) and even openly says that he \"tried to protect\" Jimmie from those accusations. Some of these events of sexual assault happened DURING his live show!\n\nThe week after that, he finally admits that one of his former moderators (which Petty Paige once did a whole video on), who likely had a lot of contact and influence over his fans at the time, was a pedophile and asking for nudes from underage h3 fans. Ethan never thought to warn his fans about this or even acknowledge it happened before now... he only brought it up when he thought he could weaponize it in an attempt to discredit someone who said they hated working for him (Ethan also got it wrong... it was a different moderator who came forward).\n\nNow, after all of this, he really thought it was a good idea to put his 5-year-old in his content this week. I used to justify the fact that sometimes his kids would show up while he was working from home and Ethan was streaming SYNT, and felt those moments were reasonable... but this time he drove him to the studio, put a microphone on him and had him do react and toy content. It's just such a weird choice to make when there are so many RECENT sexual abuse allegations that would make his workplace not a safe environment for children.\n\nAnyway, thank you for coming to my rant. I'm just so frustrated that this is getting somewhat brushed aside. If Ethan wasn't a white cis male, I feel like the internet would be in uproar over this. But, per usual, Ethan gets away with some of the most disgusting and inappropriate shit without anyone prominent calling out how disturbing things are at H3.",

My religious parents were adamant about \"choosing life\" (while maintaining their crystal clear imagine in the community), and I was sent to live with my grandmother for my 7th grade year. I ended up giving birth a few weeks after my 13th birthday, and immediately placed handed the child over to her adoptive parents. (Who at the time seemed like wonderful people).\n\nThe only people who even knew of my pregnancy in my life (aside from authorities/medical personnel) were my parents, my grandmother, one of my brothers, and my therapist. My husband is also aware.\n\nI'm now 32, I have been married to the man of my dreams for two years, and pregnant with what will be our first children together. ('Lucked out' with twins, as we requires IVF to conceive).\n\nIt took me the rest of my childhood and the better part of my 20's to get over what happened to me. I finally was able to heal, put it past me, and now for the past five years or so, I'm able to go months at a time without thinking about it.\n\nI had a closed adoption, I made it clear to the adoptive parents I wanted absolutely no contact what so ever, and I never held the baby I gave away, something I do not regret to this day. I have avoided ever having social media, partially to avoid 'being found.'\n\nIn the beginning of September, I received a phone call from a PI letting me know my biological daughter wanted to meet me, and had hired him to track me down. I immediately made it clear I have no interest in contact, and to please leave me alone.\n\nBy the end of November I had received multiple phone calls and letters from my biological daughter, begging me to meet her. I wrote her a letter in return, telling her I'm happy she's had a great life, but that I have no interest in contact. I made it clear, I will not stop her at all from reaching out to extended family, I won't be mad if she 'outs me' as her biological mother, and pursues a relationship with my relatives. She did reach out to my brother, who immediately blocked her on facebook. (I would prefer she didn't, but I don't think it's my place to keep her from doing so.)\n\nOn Tuesday, she showed up at my front door while I was at work, my husband answered, and immediately told her to please leave, or he would have to call the police. I don't know what to do, I don't know how to explain to her in any other way, that I do not want to meet her. I also don't want to be cruel. I don't view her as my 'daughter,' as horrible as that sounds. I do wish her the best, but I have built a life I'm finally comfortable with, I don't want her to be part of it. If there is any insight any adoptees could provide on how I could explain this to her without having to just be brutally honest and also sparing her feelings. Or 'birthmoms' who have gone through a similar thing.\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n>deleted: Comment deleted by user\n\n>>**OOP:** I ended up writing her another letter, explaining how she was conceived, how many years it took for me to finally feel like a human being again, and how my unwillingness to meet her has nothing to do with her personally, and everything to do with needing to preserve my own mental health. I asked that she please leave myself, and the one brother she reached out to alone. I again stressed, I would not stop her from reaching out to extended family and I included a packet of information about our family medical history and some watercolor pictures that my grandmother and I made together when I was pregnant with her.\n\n/\n\n>SuddenlyZoonoses: [\u2026] Question: Did her adoptive parents know about the circumstances of her conception? [\u2026]\n\n>>**OOP:** Her parents were made aware by my parents about details surrounding her conception before the adoption took place. [\u2026]\n\n/\n\n>Go_Kauffy: While I don't condone her behavior, *do* try to understand what forces would drive someone to behave that way.\n\n>What you and your husband are doing is, to put it very bluntly, a cruelty. It's understandable, but no less cruel.\n\n>It makes sense that you don't view her as your daughter-- but it also makes sense that she might seek to know *who she is* by knowing you. As an adopted kid growing up, I wondered endlessly about who I was, and I felt like the only way to get a sense of it was to track down biological relatives. Which I did do and, funny enough, I experienced a little bit of what you describe doing to her. It more-or-less worked out for me.\n\n>She's a 19-year-old woman who just wants to know who she is. It actually may be healing *for you also* to erase the trauma of what you went through at 13, and giving up the child then, by replacing it with this new person, whom you may find you relate to as a peer, rather than your child. You may see her more as a younger sister, and that may actually be a great relationship for the two of you.\n\n>The best situation I could see happening would be for you to welcome her interest, and accept her as a legitimate part of your life and family-- for you and your husband to get over your resistance to the fact that she exists (I know my own birthmother's husband had to deal with this to a degree). Resisting her will actually just make things more unpleasant and have them linger (like the second shoe that never drops), while dropping the resistance may be the most peaceful path to her leaving on her own, or better yet, co-creating the kind of relationship that works for everyone involved.\n\n>Obviously, as an adopted kid, I'm going to advocate for other adopted kids getting whatever they can to gain some closure about their own adoption experience. Adoption is, itself, traumatic-- and it echoes throughout life. I think it would do both of you a world of good to hop on a phone together and for you to explain what your resistance is about.\n>>**OOP:** Nothing will erase the trauma I went through at 12 and 13 years old. In the span of a little over a year I went from a little girl who still played with barbies, to being forced to go through the extremely traumatic birth of an unwanted child.\n\n>>She is welcome to be a part of the lives and family of my extended family. Someday when my own children are grown, they are free to know and love her. For may own life, I choose not to have her as part of it. As painful as it is, she is a physical reminder of the worst events that have ever happened to myself and my brother.\n\n>>Telling me it may be \"healing for me or erase my abuse\" to get to know her is, in a way, condescending.\n\n>>At no point did I attempt to make a claim that I know her trauma, nor will I ever trivialize it. I will never know the loss she feels, or the pain and unique trauma that comes along with being an adoptee. I won't claim to know what's best for her to heal, or any other person. I wish her nothing but the best, but I won't be hopping on the phone with her anytime soon.\n\n>>I won't pretend to know your trauma, don't pretend to know mine.\n\n>>I wish you and your family happiness and health. Adoption is challenging, and it seems often, tragic for many parties involved.\n\n/\n\n>iamnotroberts: Threatening to have your daughter arrested because she wants to meet you seems a bit excessive.\n\n>>**OOP:** A woman who is a stranger to my husband, showed up at our front door, demanding to see his wife (me), in the middle of a pandemic, while I am 26 weeks pregnant with our first children. She was shouting demanding to see me, and he calmly told her to leave, or he would get the police involved. I don't think he acted out of line, or in excess.\n\n>>>iamnotroberts: You didn't say that in your original post. All you wrote was \"On Tuesday, she showed up at my front door while I was at work, my husband answered, and immediately told her to please leave, or he would have to call the police.\"\n\n>>>>**OOP:** At the time, it didn't seem necessary to say? She, a stranger, that I expressed I did not want ANY contact with, presumably drove across state lines to come to my HOME, while I am knowingly pregnant during a pandemic to see me. I am sympathetic to everything she's going through, but it was extremely unsettling for my husband, and I don't blame him at all. He understandably protective of me.\n\n/\n\n>spooki_coochi: It\u2019s unsettling to see so many people refer to this 19yo girl as some malicious woman including OP. She\u2019s a child and she is acting like one.\n\n>>**OOP:** At no point did I make her out to be a malicious woman.\n\n>>She is definitely young, and I understand that that is part of where her lack of impulse control comes from. I have given her as much of an explanation as I am willing to, I hope that she finds peace, and closure in whatever it is she is looking for. Now that I have made her aware of the details surrounding her conception, I hope she can understand better why I make the choices I am making. I am someone places a lot of value in having my space and boundaries respected.\n\n>>I don't feel I 'owe her' anything. I was a child myself when she was born, and we are both victims of the same man who forced us into this situation. I do not view her as 'my daughter', and I do not view myself as 'her mother.' I think we are two people biologically tied as 'parent' and offspring, and tied by a series of extremely traumatic events that we had no choices in. I did not feel familial kinship for her while I was forced to keep an unwanted pregnancy, and I did not feel familial kinship for her when I was forced through a traumatic birth, and to be brutally honest, I do not feel familial kinship towards her now. I wish her well, and I hope she finds peace, but I do not feel in anyway a parent to her.\n\n>>I don't know her trauma and will never know her trauma, in the same ways that she will never know mine. I don't think she has malicious intent.\n\n>>>ska4fun: Yes you did. But when confronted about that, several times, simply deny the misconstruction of the poor girl.\n\n>>>>**OOP:** I have empathy for her, to a point.\n\n>>>>We all have the right to our boundaries being respected.\n\n\n**UPDATE:** [things didn't turn out great: Conflicted, biological child reached out, but I don't want to be found](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adoption/comments/kjkbha/update_things_didnt_turn_out_great_conflicted/) **24 December 2020**\n\nTLDR; When I was 13, I gave birth after being forced to go through a pregnancy that resulted from incest/rape. The child was adopted through a closed adoption. After she initiated contact/sought a 'reunion', I declined wanting contact, and she has now shown up at my home twice. I reluctantly agreed to a phone call with said young woman today, and I now how no doubts that she is entirely unwelcome in my life.\n\nAs stated in responses to comments in my original posts, I ended up writing my birth daughter another letter explaining to her the circumstances of her birth, and why I do not want contact with her. I also included a few watercolors I did with my grandmother while I was pregnant with her, and an extensive packet of information regarding family medical history. I overnight fedexed it to the address I had for her.\n\nSadly, in the late hours of last night, she showed up at my house again, this time while I was home, and pounded on my front door, screaming. My husband and I tried to ignore it, but a we got a phone call from out neighbors that they would call the police if we didn't answer our door/handle the situation, and I honestly didn't want to start Christmas Eve with getting someone clearly going through the thick of it arrested. My husband spoke to her via our home doorbell/alarm system thing. When this did not placate her, I literally barricaded myself in our bathroom, and he went out the backdoor, locking it, and then around the front to speak to her.\n\nI could hear him screaming at her, unpleasant, but apparently effective, because she finally left. This morning, I received a phone call from her adoptive parents apologizing to me, that they never fully disclosed how she was conceived, and that they helped fund the PI which is how she found me, hoping it would lead to a more happy reunion. What they did tell me they told her, that she was the result of rape, what they lied to her about was that it was my parents who made me give her away, and that I \"always loved her, chose life, and wanted to keep her if I had been older.\" All lies, and it seems she received a similar very religious upbringing, that I did.\n\nI ended up agreeing to speak with her on the phone, facilitated by her birth parents, if she understood that now she has to leave me alone, or I will pursue legal advice, and will not hesitate to call the police if she were to ever come to my home ever again.\n\nI was very blunt with her, because I felt that she's already been lied to 100 times. It probably would have been better to do the conversation through a therapist, but honestly I'm just happy it's over.\n\nShe asked me if I loved her as her daughter they way I loved the children I'm pregnant with. I told I have love for her as a human being, but that I would not lie and say I felt like a mother to her. That she's only five years younger than my own husband, and that I don't love her in any maternal way, but I do love for her as my sister in humanity.\n\nShe asked me do I wish I had an abortion, I said that at the time, I wanted an abortion. That the trauma I felt would have been significantly reduced if I were allowed to terminate the pregnancy forced upon me by my rapist. I also said I wouldn't go back and change what happened now, because she already exists, and I would never wish away her existence.\n\nShe asked me about my faith and if I am still a *insert out very conservative religious background, that I guess she shares.*. I told her no, that I am not even a Christian.\n\nShe asked me about my political beliefs and if I support 'murdering babies.' I said I am 100% pro choice, that I am a socialist and an anticapitalist, but that I don't think being conservative makes you a bad person (not really related, but I felt the need to say it).\n\nWe talked about other things for a bit, mostly her asking me, because if I'm being honest, I don't really care to ask her anything about herself.\n\nShe asked me if I forgave her birth father, and if I ever spoke to him, and if I would ever consider visiting him with her. I told her that I never will forgive him. That I don't ascribe to Christian ideas of having to forgive. When pressed further about information related to him, I told her to ask my parents for any further information, and take the time to read the letter second I wrote her.\n\nI provided her mother with contact information for my own parents.\n\nI'm hoping to close this chapter of my life. I can't imagine speaking with me gave her much peace, but I hope she's satisfied.\n\nMy husband and I are now considering moving so that she can't find us again. I don't feel any better having spoken with her, if anything, I'm reassured about choosing never to see her in person. She seems like a broken person, and I hope she finds her own healing, but I do not want her as part of my life.\n\nShe seems like the kind of person I wouldn't get along with, and would never respect boundaries. I get that she has so much trauma of her own, and I hope she is able to leave the religious community she belongs to, unless she's happy there.\n\nI don't feel guilty that her life wasn't everything it could have been, I do feel sympathy that she obviously has been raised in a similar toxic religious household. I am glad this is over, I've disconnected my landline, and am changing my cellphone number.\n\nI am going to restart therapy at the beginning of next year and if she ever shows up at my home again I will being calling the police.\n \n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n>1SecretUpvote: You did everything possible to help her while still keeping that boundary clear, I applaud you for that. I know this was very distributive to your life and she had no right to it and obviously crossed the line multiple times. It makes a lot more sense now hearing about the involvement of the adoptive parents and how they have hurt the situation.\n\n>They should have never ever told her those things, never cross a line with the PI, and never encouraged her to keep pursuing this. It was completely inappropriate and entirely their fault honestly, the girl is just acting in the way you would expect for her age and upbringing in the context of what she had been told.\n\n>I'm sure that as she gets older she will think back to this and possibly read through everything you gave her multiple times. She will be able to process it and most likely be able to understand where you're coming from. She will appreciate the information and the honesty at some point, she just is a child and everything that she had ever thought about the situation and the possibilities of a relationship is completely wrong. That's a lot to stomach for anyone let alone a kid.\n\n>Try not to be angry with her about this, if anything be angry at those parents. They are the ones responsible for putting her on this mission.\n\n>>**OOP:** I'm not angry with her. I don't hate her. She's obviously a scared, teenager in need of guidance, and I hope she finds the answers she is looking for.\n\n/\n\n>deleted: Is her birth father in prison? Did he ever get any kind of punishment? Also im so sorry for everything that has happened. Being pregnant after a forced pregnancy is soooo hard. I was also pregnant after I was raped and now that im pregnant again ive noticed things being weird in my head. [...]\n\n>>**OOP:** He spent sixteen years in prison, he raped six members of my family in one year, including myself.\nBeing pregnant after having been pregnant from abuse is strange for sure. My pregnancy are nearly two decades apart, but it has brought back weird feelings. I literally chose this pregnancy, my husband and I used IVF, and sometimes I have double think first thing in the morning of horror at reaction of my baby bump. [...]\n\n/\n\n>deleted: Comment removed by moderator\n>>**OOP:** I am now living in a hotel rather than staying in my house while I\u2019m pregnant to avoid having to call the police on her. You\u2019re right in that, I don\u2019t know her, I don\u2019t feel overwhelming and hopefully-warm love for her like a mother would, but I care about her as a person. I care for her in that I believe she deserves the very best life, and answers to her questions, and emotional support. I just can\u2019t be the one to provide it. I am barely holding it together, I\u2019ve done what I thought showed her respect while respecting myself.\n\n>>You have no right at all to ascribe intentions or feelings towards my actions.\n\n/\n\n>FoxyFreckles1989: [\u2026] The adoptive parents completely disregarded their promise made when adopting her: to keep her safe. Nothing they told her kept her emotionally safe, and even put her in potential physical danger by encouraging and facilitating the hiring of a PI which is what lead to these late-night door-poundings and overly emotional decision making. I\u2019m so angry at them for OP and for her.\n\n>>**OOP:** They were unfair to her, and I am angry with them for this reason, and not her. I\u2019m so pissed they lied to her. I\u2019m also a bit angry with my own parents, because at the time of the adoption I was told her parents were nondenominational Christians and not part of my parent\u2019s insane sect of Christianity.\n\n>>>FoxyFreckles1989: Wow. It just keeps getting worse. I\u2019m really sorry. I\u2019d be extremely angry with the adoptive parents, as well. I might be more inclined to give my parents the benefit of the doubt and ask if they\u2019d been lied to, as well, since the adoptive parents are obviously extremely dishonest\u2014willing to tell reprehensible lies to their own child to avoid a difficult conversation. You mentioned that your parents have grown and changed immensely since this all happened. Would you be able to discuss this with them to get some answers and work towards closure, perhaps once you\u2019re back in therapy and have guidance?\n\n>>>>**OOP:** Igenuinely thought her parents were good people, all my life (or at least all her life). It never crossed my mind, they weren\u2019t. I would have fought harder for a better set of people had I known they were the same type of Christians as my parents.\n\n>>>>Im definitely going to be speaking with my parents about this, with the facilitation of a mental health professional, when given the chance. Honestly, my parents were such jerks and liars when I was a kid, they genuinely may not remember telling this specific lie.\n\n>>>>They are pretty awesome people now, and have spent like 15 years working so hard to change, I obviously don\u2019t excuse their behavior ever, but I do think they will be open to talk about this, and admit their part. If you are talking about speaking with her parents, I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\n>>>>>ska4fun: I just asked this some seconds ago... The parents who allowed to be raped and rugswept it, are more deserving of empathy, consideration than the poor girl, innocent in all that mess? Come on\u2026\n\n>>>>>>**OOP:** I know my parents. They raised me. They are far far far from perfect, I don\u2019t see them all the time, but I have an established relationship with them that spans 32 years.\n\n>>>>>>My biological child is a stranger to me. I don\u2019t know her, I don\u2019t know her intentions. I haven\u2019t spend 100s is hours in therapy with her, over nearly two decades, picking apart and rebuilding our relationship.\n\n>>>>>>She\u2019s now come to my home uninvited, three times, after I\u2019ve asked her multiple times to leave me alone, she\u2019s stalked me at this point, and I\u2019ve done nothing but try to be sympathetic to her.\n\n>>>>>>My parents aren\u2019t perfect people, but they\u2019ve spent over a decade fundamentally reassessing who they are, what they believe and the role they played in the traumatic childhood of my brother and I. They respect every boundary I ask of them nowadays, they know the part they played and own up to how fucked if they were when I was a kid, and they are amazing parents to much much much younger brother than they ever were to my brother and I. My relationship with my own parents isn\u2019t up for debate here.\n\n>>>>>>**OOP:** Just to make it clear my parents absolutely never allowed myself or my brother to be raped.\n\n>>>>>>**OOP:** I never said they were more deserving of empathy than her. I don\u2019t think they are. Additionally, my parents again, far from perfect, but did support my brother, myself. My maternal cousins, and my paternal aunt emotionally when we testified against our rapist.\n\n/\n\n>deleted: Comment deleted by user\n>>**OOP:** I disagree. I was a child when I had her against my will, I begged my parents and then my grandmother to please not force me to give birth. I don't know what more could be asked of me, I made it clear I did not want contact with her. She pushed for contact, and I gave it to her. I'm not going to lie to her, her adoptive parents have already done enough of that.\n\n>>I hope she heals, I hope she has a great life, I just don't want any part of it. Honestly, I hope she has a great relationship with her biological grandparents (my own parents), if that's what she wants.\n\n>>I hope she meets them, and I hope they give her the biological connection she craves. They are entirely different people they were when I was young, and I can honestly say they are good people now. (I would not classify them as good parents when I was growing up, but decades and a lot of therapy can change things). I hope she finds joy, I hope she finds peace.\n\n\n**Reminder - I am not the original poster.**\n",

However, I just watched about 30 videos of events that took place today. What I saw was not people fighting for their homeland but people murdering, desecrating corpses innocent people. This is terrorism, plain and simple. In a couple instances it was Israeli soldiers which is at least not innocent civilians but the way they treated their bodies and paraded them and stomped on them is disgusting. I can now see why Israel needs to defend itself and it's people. I don't think they should be bombing equally innocent people on the Palestine side but I can see why they should defend themselves because the things I saw today we're revolting and horrific. I still think both sides should still strive to find peace but I am not sure if this is even possible after today's acts. Hamas likely will need to be eradicated and eliminated, vile people.\n\nHas anyone else changed their mind, either way?",

I know - conflict zones are contradictory places for UFO spotting, because of all other flying objects in the sky, but i just stumbled across this video from Kurskaya Oblast from today\u2019s event, Russia. In this video at the moment when a fighter jet fly by - in a split second you can see two round dark objects, they appear in a single frame, and then - in the second frame - you can see, possibly, the third object on top right corner, or maybe it is one of those two objects that was spotted in the first frame. As a photographer - i know it couldn\u2019t be out of focus dirt on the windshield of the car, for example, cuz jets and sky then would be blurry. It also can\u2019t be any rockets of anything regular, i suppose. It reminds me of the videos when you see something cross the sky superfast on the aviation shows, i remember couple of videos like that, if you\u2019re longtime UFO lurker you probably know what i\u2019m talking about. Not saying it is something extraordinary for sure, but saying it is worth attention, especially with the second frame where you can see, possibly, the same object. Once again, it\u2019s in top right corner, also appears for a single frame. Lmk what you think, any discussion is appreciated.",

My sister, Emma, is getting married in a few weeks, and I've been excited to be part of her special day. However, here's where the dilemma begins.\n\nI'm a medical student, and my final exams are scheduled to take place on the same day as her wedding. This wasn't my choice; it's a university-mandated exam date. I've been working tirelessly for years to get to this point, and failing these exams is not an option.\n\nI explained the situation to Emma, and she was extremely upset. She accused me of not caring about her, being selfish, and prioritizing my education over her big day. She even said that I could \"find a way to make it work\" if I wanted to. Her and my parents are putting a lot of pressure on me to reschedule the exams or find a way to attend the wedding.\n\nI feel caught between a rock and a hard place. I don't want to miss my sister's wedding, but I also can't jeopardize my entire medical career because of the scheduling conflict. AITA for choosing my exams over her wedding, or is she being unreasonable in her expectations?",

Global debt levels reaching a record high of $220 Trillion after the covid pandemic loans\n\n**Nationalism and Populism**\n\n* 1930s : Nationalist and facism movements gained huge momentum and people were in need of leadership to restore national pride and address economic issues\n* Today : Nationalist and right-wing populist movements are rising in many countries, often as reaction to europeanization, globalization and cultural pressure. We also witnessed movements such as Brexit emphasizing national sovereignty and better control over immigration.\n\n**Geopolitical Tensions**\n\n* 1930s : Territorial ambitions and unresolved grievances from World War I led to aggressive expansionism by countries like Germany, Italy, and Japan.\n* Today : There are ongoing territorial disputes and power struggles, particularly involving major powers like the US, China, and Russia. There are major escalations going on as of right now (Ukraine, Israel)\n\n**Cultural and Identity conflicts**\n\n* 1930s : Anti-Semitism, racism, and xenophobia were rampant, leading to discriminatory policies and violence.\n* Today : Similar cultural and identity conflicts are evident, with rising xenophobia, anti-immigrant sentiment, and ethnic tensions. There also seems to be a rise of \"anti-culture\"\n\n**Militarism and military spend**\n\n* 1930s : post WW1 conflict, there was an increased focus on militarism and military spend\n* Today : Global military expenditure has been rising to over 2 trillion and is constantly growing\n\nSome key differences that could help prevent further escalation\n\n* Organizations like UN, NATO and other regional instances should help in conflict prevention and resolution.\n* Large scale wars would be economically damaging to many involved parties as we have a highly interconnected world\n* Nuclear deterrence \n* Technology (although this could easily be seen as conflict facilitator)\n\nSo - are we seeing the same signals building up over time again?

I have nothing but sympathy for the civilian victims of this conflict and any other war for that matter.  I also want to say that I understand that wars are inherently evil undertakings but there are times where there is a clear aggressor and a clear victim.  I would count the current conflict in Ukraine among those.  \n\n\rI was born in the Russian-speaking Eastern portion of Ukraine in 1980 and I am still in touch with many relatives over there.  I know people who have gone all in for Putin and his narrative of \u201cNazism\u201d in Ukraine (I also have relatives who moved to Israel in the 1990s, they have excommunicated me for my opposition to Israeli militarism).  People who support Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine are among the most gullible and least intellectually curious people on the face of the earth.  Russia is clearly the bad guy.     \n\n\rWith that out of the way, to me there is no clear \u201cgood side\u201d in the entire Israel-Palestine conflict. Why do I say so?\n\n\rLet\u2019s start with Israel.  Displacing an indigenous population with settlers is a real 17th century move.  What the fuck did you expect when you opened up a \u201csafe haven\u201d for Jewish people in the Middle East?  And your claim that the Bible gives this venture legitimacy to some \"promised land for Jews\" is just laughable.  The Bible also says that a guy put two of every species of a wooden boat, the Bible says that a lady turned into a pillar of salt.  I don\u2019t think that the Bible is a valid document for making political claims. \n\n \rAfter forcibly removing the local Palestinian population the Israelis settlers forced them into smaller and smaller reservations, essentially mirroring what white settlers did to native populations in North America.  Is it any surprise that people are pissed off, that this has resulted in a lot of violence and death?  Could there have been any other outcome?  Maybe they should have tried what South Africa did in the 1990s, instead of doubling down on apartheid and oppression.  \n\n\rAs for the Palestinian leadership, I am certainly sympathetic to their cause, but their approach is just disgusting without fail.   Going back to the 1970s as far as I know, they have been consistently targeting innocents: [athletes in the 1972 Munich Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_massa), [1990s suicide bombings of buses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Palestinian_suicide_attacks), and now [this sickening attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hamas_attack_on_Israel) that happened a couple of weeks ago. \n\n\rA lot of my left-leaning friends will say, \u201chow can we tell an oppressed people how they should resist oppression?\u201d, to which I say, \u201cwe can\u2019t, but we sure as shit don\u2019t have to support this!\u201d  And, of course, look at Gandhi and Martin Luther King!  These guys were able to take on far more powerful and wealthier opponents because they refused to meet violence with violence and were able to expose the inherently brutal nature of racism and colonialism for the world to see. \n\n\rAnd at the end of the day, it is a popularity contest.  Palestine has a cause that any rational person would see as just but when they commit terrible acts against innocent people, it\u2019s easy to lose sight of that.  Especially if you are courting the favor of fickle and easily distracted American voters.  Which is something they ought to be doing.  Whether it should be this way or not, it would be extremely beneficial to their struggle if there were popular demand in Western societies to support a free Palestine.  \n\n\rBut violence is not only ugly, it also does not work.  Can you imagine if Gandhi or MLK had taken beheaded hostages or kidnapped athletes or bombed a crowded bus, the retribution taken upon their followers and the populations they claimed to represent would have been swift and terrible.\n\n\rJust as we are seeing in Gaza now.  This does not make it OK, of course, but it was absolutely to be expected.  If the Israelis have proven one thing to be true since 1947, it\u2019s that they are pretty tough in a fight.  So, I think that we can say that violence should be a non-starter for any Palestinian leader and I\u2019m going to say, I have absolutely zero sympathy for any of their leadership that undertakes attacks on Israeli civilians. \n\n\r  \nCan anyone change my view?  Am I wrong to not be able to see one of these sides as better than the other?\r  \n",

Since public schools refuse him, it puts the city on the hook to pay for the child's private school. \n\n\nThe reason he it took so long for him to get taken out of public schools is because of the law that every child is entitled to an education in the least restrictive setting possible.

            "body": "Hank and I have been asked a lot to comment on the conflict between Israel and Palestine, and I understand why people want to hear from us.\n\nThere\u2019s a [Crash Course video on the history of the conflict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wo2TLlMhiw). \n\nBut on October 7th, there was a horrific terrorist attack in which the organization Hamas killed over a thousand Israeli civilians and kidnapped hundreds more. Hamas is a militant group that has frequently attacked Israel (and also killed many Palestinian civilians). Hamas has been the primary political leadership in the Gaza Strip since a [coup in 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gaza_(2007)).\n\nThis attack is especially horrifying because it represented the [greatest loss of civilian life](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/12/hamass-attack-was-the-bloodiest-in-israels-history) among Jewish people since the Holocaust, and I think it\u2019s important to understand that many of us don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be less than one human lifetime removed from a systematic effort to end your people via the murder of over six million of them. Amid a huge surge of anti-Semitic actions globally, echoes of that tragedy, whether they come in the form of attacks on synagogues or lynch mobs in Dagestan, are especially terrifying because of the history involved.\n\nOne thing I think we find challenging as a species is to acknowledge the shared legitimacy of conflicting narratives. That is to say, there is legitimacy to the Israeli narrative that Jews need a secure homeland because historically when they haven\u2019t had one, it has been catastrophic, and as we have seen again recently, anti-Semitism continues to be a terrifyingly powerful and profound force in the human story. There is also legitimacy to the Palestinian narrative that over the last seven decades, many Palestinians have been forced off their land and now live as stateless refugees in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where their freedom of movement and assembly is highly restricted, and that the long history of violence in the region has disproportionately victimized Palestinians.\n\nFor civilians in Gaza, there is simply nowhere to go. They cannot go to Egypt, and they cannot go to Israel. And since Hamas\u2019s terrorist attack, thousands of bombs have been dropped by the Israeli government onto areas of Gaza where civilians cannot help but be. The Israeli government argues the war is necessary to remove Hamas from power and cripple it as a military force. But the human cost of those bombings is utterly devastating, and I\u2019m not convinced that civilian death on such a scale can ever be justified. Thousands of civilians have died in Gaza in the past three weeks, and many thousands more will die before Hamas is completely destroyed, which is the stated goal of the Israeli offensive. It\u2019s heartbreaking. So many innocent people are being traumatized and killed\u2013children and elderly people and disabled people who are unable to travel to the purportedly safer regions of Gaza. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u201cboth sidesism\u201d to say that civilian death from violence is, on any side, inherently horrific.\n\nSave the Children, an organization we trust and have worked with for over a decade, recently said, \u201cThe number of children reported killed in just three weeks in Gaza is more than the number killed in armed conflict globally \u2026 for the last three years.\u201d Doctors without Borders, another organization we\u2019ve worked with closely, reports: \u201cThere is no safe space in Gaza. When fuel runs out, every person on a ventilator, premature baby in an incubator will die. We need an immediate ceasefire.\u201d I am trying to listen to a variety of trusted voices, and this is what some of the voices I trust are telling me.\n\nI don\u2019t know what else to say except that I\u2019m so scared and sad for all people who live in constant fear and under constant threat. I pray for peace, and an immediate end to the violence. But mostly, I am committed to listening. Even when it is hard to listen, even when I am listening to those I disagree with, I want to do so with real openness and in search of understanding. I will continue to try to listen a lot more than I speak\u2013not just when it comes to this conflict, but with all issues where I have a lot to learn.\n\nThanks for reading. Please be kind to each other in comments if you can. Thanks.",

The product has been going great and I have no reason to complain or return it. \n\nToday I saw them on sale for $70. Clearly Costco is trying to get rid of their inventory at that price. \n\nI asked the returns people if they price match. They said they only do it for thirty days.\n\nI then asked if I could purchase the cheaper one and - since it's the same item number - do a return on the one I bought a few months ago. The employee told me that if you do that and try to do a return that it will only show the most recent purchase which would have been for the $70. \n\nI finally asked if I could return my used Thirsti for the $150 and then just buy a new one for $70. He said \"yeah, you can do that.\"\n\nThat just feels so immoral, but damn $80 is a lot.\n\nI'm not complaining about the thirty day price matching because that makes total sense or their return policy which is the greatest in the world, but together they do create an incentive to be very wasteful. I could get a brand new device, refills on the CO2 and flavors, and make $80 if I feel like being an asshole. But the point of buying it in the first place was to be more environmentally friendly and I'm quite sure the used device wouldn't be resold. \n\nI feel like in situations like this they should make an exception for the 30 day return policy. \n\nFor the record, I won't be returning my used device. I've asked my neighbor to look for it on their next run. If it's still there I'll pay them back for it and then return it on my card since it's the same item number. ",

I wanted to post this in a relationship advice group, but the subject matter isn\u2019t allowed.\n\nMy ex-husband and I were married for 10 years, although the last 2 were spent in variations of separation. \n\nWe\u2019ve been divorced for roughly a year. \n\nWe have 3 kids: 10, 8, 5\n\nI\u2019m pregnant with our 4th baby. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll actually be parents to 4 kids or not. I\u2019m so conflicted. We are so conflicted. \n\nThere was no abuse or cheating in our marriage, although he did sleep with somebody else during our separation. There are a variety of other reasons why we ultimately got divorced.\n\nAfter the initial feelings of failure and heartache, and there was an immense amount of heartache on my end despite being the one who filed for divorce, we were able to get along pretty well. It become platonic so quickly and it\u2019s like when we removed the romantic and married relationship from the equation things got so much better. We split time with our kids 50/50. That\u2019s really hard for me because being mom is such a huge part of my identity that I still sometime struggle to know what to do with myself during his time with the kids. Ultimately I\u2019m happy that he\u2019s a loving involved father and I\u2019m glad that it they do spend half their time with him, even if I still sometimes cry over not being with them all the time. We still do things together as a family sometimes. We sit together at our kids\u2019 activities, things like that. \n\nHe has a girlfriend now. She seems nice. He let her not long after our divorce was finalized. It hurt. I cried way too much over it. He waited over 6 months to introduce her to our kids, which I was thankful for. My kids like her. \n\nOur youngest child was unexpectedly admitted to the hospital not long ago. He had surgery. In the grand scheme of things it was a pretty minor surgery and he\u2019s absolutely fine now, but this is my baby and he had to spend multiple nights in the hospital, so this was a big deal for me. My ex-husband was there the entire time, being a great dad, being a supportive \u201cpartner\u201d to me as I worried over every little thing. We spent all those nights in the hospital together and I remembered why I married him. He was always able to be the strong, level headed rock for me. He was this safe person who I knew would take care of everything and protect me. When we were in the hospital he told me that I\u2019m the most important woman in his life, still.\n\nWhen our son was discharged, my ex-husband came back to my house. MY baby was home safe, our other two children were excited to be home after staying with my husband\u2019s sister for several nights. We were all together at home like a family again. That night after our kids were in bed we had sex. I hadn\u2019t been hoping for it or planning it.  It was just like as soon as the kids were tucked away I\u2019m their rooms we were having this intensely passionate, needy, amazing sex that we shouldn\u2019t have been having. We went to sleep in my bed and at some point in the middle of the night we had sex again. \n\nThe next morning we both decided our emotions with the whole situation with our son just got the better of us. We said we didn\u2019t regret sleeping together but that\u2019s all it was and we were just going to go back to our normal divorced lives. We wouldn\u2019t make it awkward, just move on. \n\nThen I found out I was pregnant. We didn\u2019t use a condom. I don\u2019t even have condoms in my house anymore. I\u2019m not on birth control. I haven\u2019t been since we divorced. I haven\u2019t needed it since I haven\u2019t had the time or interest ti start dating again. I really wanted to be single for a while. I know I was ovulating when we slept together, which was probably a contributing subconscious factor as to why it happened. My body sees him being a good dad to our kids and it wants another! My cycle is like clockwork and we\u2019ve always conceived on the first try every time we\u2019ve \u201ctried\u201d to get pregnant. Our first kid was not even a try, it was a \u201ctwo weeks before your wedding you find out you\u2019re pregnant and spend your honeymoon with morning sickness\u201d surprise.\n\nSo now I\u2019m about 8 weeks pregnant. I\u2019ve known for about a week. I just told him this past weekend. I didn\u2019t know if I would tell him at all. I realize now that I only told him in hopes that he\u2019d tell me what to do and figure the situation out for me. Only he didn\u2019t. \n \nI know it makes no sense to have a baby with somebody I chose to divorce. I don\u2019t need a 4th child. Why can\u2019t I let go of this though?",

However, when he says stuff like 90% or 100% of Jews think x or y or z I\u2019m like\u2026 where are you getting these stats from? He says the only thing he can\u2019t concede is that Israel should be wiped off of the map. Is that the anti-Zionist argument, because in my understanding, anti-Zionism (especially among AZ Jews) demands an end to an apartheid set of laws and customs in Israel, not the state itself. In other words, AZs like myself are pushing for major reform in the Israeli government, not complete destruction of the country and its people. \n\nJust want to know if I\u2019m the only person who thinks this way. \u262e\ufe0f and \u2764\ufe0f \n\n** A lot of people are responding with: well, that makes you a Zionist, which I disagree with. I think I might have misspoken a bit. When I said that I don\u2019t demand an end to the Israeli state, I should\u2019ve specified that I disagree with enforcing a mass deportation or annihilation of the people living in modern day Israel and damage to the land itself \u2014 which I feel like Ethan implies AZs seek when he speaks of \u201cwiping Israel off the map.\u201d I think the dismantlement of Israel that many AZs aim for, especially Jewish AZs is on a governmental and ideological level. AZs fundamentally oppose building a statehood that revolves around a racial hierarchy in which Jews are at the top. The idea is that all racial and/or religious hierarchies are immoral, even if those placed at the top have a history of being oppressed or currently being facing oppression in other parts of the world. \n\nAnyway, thanks for coming to my Ted Talk. Hope I was able to clarify my stance a little more. ",

[There are many accounts of the reasons why Palestinians were displaced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion_and_flight#History), ranging from being told to leave the warzone to return to a Jew-free land to being forced out by Jewish militias. [Either way I think we can all agree that displacement is not uncommon during wars](https://www.icrc.org/en/document/ihl-displacement).                                            \n\nIt is accepted that 700,000 Palestinians were displaced during this war.                \n\n[Now let's have a look at the 900,000 displaced Jews from MENA Arab nations.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_exodus_from_the_Muslim_world)\n\nThis wikipedia article gives you a nice breakdown of the antisemitic sentiments and violence that took place in the early 1900s, in North Africa some of this was due to anticolonization towards the French/Italian and some due to Nazism, but the bottom line was that Jewish CITIZENS of this country were attacked in a struggle they had not started.                     \n\nHere's one noteable example from Morroco, a country where we Mizrahim consider to have had it \"better\" than others:           \n\n*\"In June 1948, soon after*\u00a0[*Israel was established*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Declaration_of_Independence)\u00a0*and in the midst of the*\u00a0[*first Arab\u2013Israeli war*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War)*,*\u00a0[*violent anti-Jewish riots broke out in Oujda and Djerada*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Anti-Jewish_riots_in_Oujda_and_Jerada)*, leading to deaths of 44 Jews. In 1948\u201349, after the massacres,\u00a018000\u00a0Moroccan Jews left the country for Israel.\"*              \n\nArabs turned violent against MORROCAN CITIZENS simply because they were Jewish.          \n\nI'll highlight another country, one where the violence was considered the worst AND the country my family is from, Iraq:             \n\n*In 1941, immediately following the British victory in the*\u00a0[*Anglo-Iraqi War*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Iraqi_War)*, riots known as the*\u00a0[*Farhud*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farhud)\u00a0*broke out in*\u00a0[*Baghdad*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad)\u00a0*in the*\u00a0[*power vacuum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_vacuum)\u00a0*following the collapse of the pro-*[*Axis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_Powers)\u00a0*government of*\u00a0[*Rashid Ali al-Gaylani*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashid_Ali_al-Gaylani)\u00a0*while the city was in a state of instability. 180 Jews were killed and another 240 wounded; 586 Jewish-owned businesses were looted and 99 Jewish houses were destroyed.*[*^(\\[116\\])*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_exodus_from_the_Muslim_world#cite_note-FOOTNOTELevin20016-116)\n\nThis was after Nazi influence had spread to Iraq, and eventually the 180,000 Jews of Iraq would dwindle down to 5. Many anti-Zionists claim it was Zionists who blew up a synagauge in Baghdad and THAT'S what caused Iraqi Jews to leave. A simple review of actual history shows the real facts.                   \n\nSo Mizrahi Jews were betrayed by their own government, in countries they had been citizens of for generations, they were turned into refugees and ended up living in refugee camps.           \n\nConversly, the Palestinians were displaced during a war, a war involving Jews of Palestine who had already been struggling against them in violent pogroms that kicked off in the 1920s. They were not their government, they were already at odds with each other. A war broke out, the Palestinians were displced.                     \n\nAND YET the Palestinians are the ones who hold onto their history bitterly, who refuse to move on and resettle. Their descendents are still considered refugees.             \n\nMizrahi Jews had it very rough, my grandparents lived in a refugee camp in a tent with their young son. They \"upgraded\" to a two room apartment with two more kids who all had to share a bed. AND YET no Mizrahi is bitterly holding onto their grandparents lost homes or resorting to terrorism against the nations that turned against their ancestors.                  \n\nWhy should I feel bad for the Palestinians when all they have done since their \"Nakba\" is enact violence on the nation who saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of Mizrahim? Why should I feel bad when the crux of their \"suffering\" is a situation my own grandparents went through and *moved on from*?                         \n\nYou don't have to forgive my apathy but maybe at the very least you can understand it. Mizrahim lost so much property and land due to antisemitism, but we don't cry about it 70+ years later",

This straightforwardly meets the definition, since taking of houses from 700,000 people is pretty \"extensive\".\n\nA common response to this is that the territory was seized as a result of a war that was started by the Arab states; however, under the standard definition of a \"war crime\", it doesn't matter. It's still a war crime to take civilian houses even if the other side started the war.\n\nOther excuses I've heard in response to this argument have been \"The Arabs would have done the same or worse if they'd won\" and \"Arab countries were doing the same thing to Jews at the same time\". Even if true (and the second one is in fact true), none of these change the fact that it met the definition of a war crime when done by Israel. CMV.",

That article: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba\n\nThe article makes it clear that there is a significant and ongoing controversy over this term. \n\nIn one view, the \u201cNakba\u201d describes the internal displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes in 1948, the murder of thousands of Palestinians who attempted to return, and the deliberate erasure of Palestinian culture from the area (destruction of mosques, towns and villages and the renaming of geographical locations are given as examples), leading to the Palestinians becoming a \u201crefugee nation\u201d and in a state of diaspora, where it remains to this day. \n\nIn another view, the term is described as an 'Arab lie' and a 'justification for terrorism' and is described as inherently anti-Semitic. As such, the article notes that the term has been banned in Palestinian textbooks for children by the Israeli Ministry of Education.\n\nIn the Israeli view, as described in Wikipedia, the events of the Nakba are seemingly not war crimes or atrocities but fundamental to the foundation of a Jewish state and part of a larger story of Jewish liberation. \n\nI would like to know how historians view this. \n\nIs this just a question of framing? \n\nAre the \u201cfacts\u201d generally agreed upon, even though perspectives may differ as to the import of those facts? \n\nCan we say with confidence that war crimes (as we know them today) and atrocities were perpetrated against the Palestinian people at the inception of the State of Israel? \n\nDid the founders of the State of Israel end the diaspora of European Jews by inflicting a diaspora on another population?  \n\nWhat do serious scholars in this area think about these questions?",

However, I have heard from people like Ben Shapiro that the \"displacement\" was because of Arab leader telling the people to leave because they were overconfident(1948 war) and then Israel won and the Palestinians couldn't return(Besides the ones who stayed).  I just wanted to ask if this is true and get more clarification on the matter.  Thank you, and have a great day!",

            "body": "So before I start this post I want to say that I do not minimize the importance of the Nakba to the Palestinians or the gravity of that event in history, I do not deny that many thousands were expelled in the process.\n\nI want to talk about what led to the Nakba and the term itself, who coined it and what was the meaning of the term when it was originally coined.\n\nFrom the Israelis side we call this the war of independence and from the pro Palestinian side we call it the Nakba.\n\nThe war broke out immediately after the partition plan which the Jews accepted and the Arabs refused, the plan was to govern the Jews 55% of the land for a Jewish / Arab state, most of the land would have been barren desert land, and 45% of the land to an Arab state (without any barren land).\n\nThe Arabs immediately waged war against Israel with the sole intent of committing genocide against the Jews or at the bare minimum kicking all of them out, we know this because we have their leaders quotes from the time \n\nA few examples \n\nMufti Amin Al husseini \nOur funamental condition for cooperationg with Germany was a free hand to eradicate every last Jew from Palestine and the Arab world. I asked Hitler for an explicit undertaking to allow us to solve the Jewish problem in a manner befitting our national and racial aspirations and according to the scientific methods innovated by Germany in the hands of its Jews. The answer I got was: The Jews are yours\"\n\n\"The Arabs would not suffice with preventing partition but would continue fighting until the Zionists were annihilated and the whole of Palestine became a purely Arab state\"\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine#:~:text=Haj%20Amin%20al%2DHusseini%20said,until%20the%20Zionists%20were%20annihilated.%22\n\nFawzi al-Qawuqji\n\n\"We will have to initiate total war. We will murder, wreck and ruin everthing standing in our way, be it English, American or Jewish\"\n\n\u201cThe battle between the Arabs and the Jews is a total battle, and the only possibility is the annihilation of every Jew in Palestine and all Arab countries\u201d\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fawzi_al-Qawuqji\n\nAbd al Rahman Azzam\n\nThis will be a war of extermination and moentous massacre which will be spoken of like the tartar massace or the Crusader wars.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azzam_Pasha_quotation\n\n\nTravelinisrael video about it\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/T3aflY9XGUU?si=PKG3idGB6WgF5EWs\n\nThe Jews at the time knew that the Arabs don\u2019t want to let them have any amount of land as the Arabs looked at Jews as unequal to them, as in all Arabs countries at the time the Jews were dhimmis, the Arabs couldn\u2019t accept Jews looking at them in eye level and would not accept any Jewish sovereignty in the land, we know that because 10 years prior to the partition plan there was the peel\ncommission which would have given Jews 18% of the land, the Jews obviously agreed and the Arabs refused (which proves that this was never about land), \n\nThe Arabs gathered their armies and marched against Israel, in doing so they also told the local Arabs who didn\u2019t pick up arms, to flee so they can take care of the Jews for them and then they could return to their homes.\n\nThe Arabs were feeling they are unbeatable with their united front against the Jews and after losing they felt such shame and humiliation that they named it Nakba or \u201cthe disaster\u201d.\n\nConstantin Zureiq, who coined the term \"The Disaster\" (The Nakba), was clear in real time that the disaster is \"Seven Arab states declare war in an attempt to subdue Zionism, stop impotent before it, and return on their heels\". The Nakba was the failure to defeat the Jews in war.\n\nSo the first time we see the word Nakba used in the context of the conflict it was not about losing their homes, it was not about losing land, it was about the shame they felt for not being able to subdue the Jews and stop them from fulfilling their national aspirations.\n\nI think that today many people use the term as it\u2019s what they were taught form young age and it very well may have evolved to mean other things but I think it\u2019s important to remember that the Muslim world mentality of associating losing with shame is still the leading factor in most of the aspects in this conflict, much like Iran threatening Israel today for hurting it, it\u2019s not about the death of any one person, it\u2019s the humiliation that must be avenged to clear their name and show they are powerful, they feel their dignity was hurt and this is the main driving force and fuel in their hatred.

            "body": "Oren here. \n\nThis one's gonna be popular I can tell. \n\nMany of you may be aware of a recent post regarding the historian and reactionary Benny and his infamous comments on an Al Jazeera program. I am not going to debate the specifics of that interview here as that post has seen plenty, but it has illuminated some key issues. \n\nThere were comments from a few users who sought to distinguish between the moral justification of ethnic cleansing and strategic, practical, or inevitable justification of ethnic cleansing. Us or them. Self preservation. Etcetera. \n\nI understand this distinction, I do. And truly believe there was no hatred or evilness that motivated these comments. \n\nHowever  I also understand the way these comments are seen to perpetuate the issue, abdicate responsibility or reckoning, and serve as a rhetorical escape for those who do not morally support ethnic cleansing but cannot bring themselves to walk down the route of fully condemning it with all of the context that was attached. \n\nThe moderation team also disagreed, along similar lines, in a respectful way. At first my conclusion was that if we were unaligned the best course of action was to er on the side of less moderation and let things ride. \n\nHowever I have since changed my mind, and I, Oren, bear ultimate and singular responsibility for that. I apologize to Mildly for changing my mind as I did and want it to be clear to everyone I respect him and where he was coming from. Ultimately the positions he provided were more nuanced and holistic than those comments I deleted. \n\nBut there were also eloquent comments pushing back in the post from many viewers, and upon hearing them echo my concerns I decided, as Admin, that ethnic cleansing apologia (perceived, adjacent, or otherwise) was not a topic on which I was prepared to compromise in this way. \n\nThis sub is not going to tolerate any form of justification, moral or otherwise, of atrocity. We deserve better than a world where atrocity is understandable. There is always a choice. Us or them is a flawed dichotomy thar has led us to cursed repitions of violence. The nakba did not prevent civil war it changed its nature and contributes to its lasting perpetration. It may have been inevitible given the  attitudes  of leaders of the time but we have a responsibility in the present to look at those mistakes  and call them what they are, and demand better for tomorrow, not inply it was an impossible *but neccesarry* decision.\n\nIt is my personal duty to take a stand on this, and if you no longer want to participate I will understand.\n\nMildly had become busy, and the situation was rapidly deteriorating on the other post. So after much personal struggle I took action. I hope to never do so again lest I ultimately abuse the power I have as an admin. \n\nThis brings up another point however: there are only two active mods. \n\nMildly and I tend to agree on things, but we aren't the same person and have limited perspectives. \n\nMy original vision was to have perspectives from all camps of leftist jews with respect to zionism to broker peace among our disparate members. And I think this stalemate that force unilateral action has shown that to be important. I am sorry it hasnt been corrected sooner. \n\nWe've tried reaching out to a few folks who stood out to us as widely respected, measured, and thoughtful, but moderation is a lot to handle, and all of them turned us down. I love yall, but you are a lot, you just are, and I think you know that. \n\nMildly is a zionist. \n\nI am a nonzionist.\n\nAn antizionist would complete the circle.\n\nIf you are an antizionist interested in helping, please modmail us. \n\nNotably, an additional antizionist probably would not have swayed the decision I unilaterally made, as most antizionists would agree with my take on the ethnic cleansing issue, but it would have been a 2-1 vote, not me taking unilateral action, which is preferable for any number of reasons. Not the least of which is when there is disagreement, there will be a tie breaker. \n\nThank you all for your patience and understanding. \n\nAt least I hope you understand ...\n\nOren\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "body": "I recently came across the movie \"Farha,\" which depicts a Palestinian perspective on the events of 1948. I have seen the movie attacked for being \"anti-semitic\" and \"false history,\" with Netflix wavering to even show it. But as somebody who studies history at college and has read on the events of 1948, I am really puzzled on where the academic basis of this perspective comes from. In my readings, I have come across various primary sources - interviews with Haganah soldiers, interviews with Palestinian victims, and even diary accounts from British advisors - all confirming that killings and other attacks on Palestinian civilians were widespread in 1948. That Haganah troops essentially utilized violence in hundreds of towns to empty the villages of Palestinian non-combatants. One of the most disturbing cases I can think of off the top of my head is Ein al-Zeitun, where 39 teenage boys were selected at random and executed with their hands tied behind their backs by Zionist forces. I also read of biological warfare being used on non-combatants, akin to that seen in North America against Indigenous Americans. Oftentimes the 1948 War is portrayed as a fight between a much weaker Israeli forces and a much larger Arab coalition. But in almost every case I could find, Zionist forces overwhelmingly outnumbered what little resistance each Palestinian town had. I was wondering if anyone with an opposing opinion has an academically vetted source which would contradict on a macro-scale my interpretation of the 1948 War. As of right now, I fail to see how any of these well documented Nakba atrocities are \"false history.\" Quite frankly, this kind of evidence in any other context would be more than enough to substantiate a general consensus that war crimes were committed. It seems that those who deny this interpretation are not doing so in good-faith and/or are misinformed, and I just want to understand the opposing interpretation a bit better. Especially as (I believe) anti-semitism is on the rise, especially on the far right, it seems dangerous to just go around labelling things as anti-semitic that simply oppose your perspective.",

But existence leaves traces, and the imprint of the Palestine that was remains, even in the absence of those expelled from their lands. It appears in the ruins of a village whose name no longer appears in the maps, in the drawing of a lost landscape, in the lyrics of a song, or in the photographs from a family album.\n\nCo-edited by Teresa Aranguren and Sandra Barrilaro and featuring a foreword by Mohammed El-Kurd, the photographs in this book are traces of that existence that have not been erased.

            "body": "I see a lot of Israeli folks downplaying or whitewashing the Nakba. Or admitting that it was bad, but just saying that the Palestinians lost and should \u201cget over it\u201d which is pretty ridiculous ngl. Just because someone lost a war doesn\u2019t make the winner somehow morally justified to do as they please, we have hard documents of wholesale massacres of civillians, rape and forced displacement, and right to return is international law. If you wanna keep your ethnostate and still maintain some semblance of morality, you\u2019ll have to provide sufficient reparations no ifs ands or buts. I\u2019m also completely behind reparations from Arab countries that expelled Jews after the declaration of Israel, seems completely fair to me, but that\u2019s unrelated to peace talks with the Palestinians themselves. The Nakba is something un-negotiable, and must not be denied during peace talks if and hopefully when they happen.\n\nJust rambling here but one state is the most just solution in an ideal world imo. I still think two states where Israel gets a significant amount more of the land, and refugee Palestinians can\u2019t return to the homes they have the keys and deeds for is still a completely unfair concession for the Palestinians, but there\u2019s just so much deep rooted hate on both sides that I would be worried for the safety of both Palestinians and Israelis if it ever happens. Maybe in the future but not today. The fact that Palestinians were overwhelmingly supportive of some form of PA taking over the strip instead of Hamas before the war, and seeing that lad Tal Mitnick and other Israeli voices taking a stand against the occupation makes me at least hopeful that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. We were close with Oslo and well RIP Rabin, thanks Netenyahu. Bellend.\n\nThe Israeli government and Hamas are both cancerous, and I find it ridiculous that people think Hamas is that much worse than the current Israeli government. They\u2019re both equally genocidal, bad for peace and pretty much par for par on policy when it comes to civilian targeting see settler violence, great march of return, most of the first intifada, the shit that\u2019s happening now, imprisonment without trial and protected physical/sexual violence against detainees etc.. At most you could argue that Israel has America and international opinion as a leash while Hamas has nothing to lose so they can and will go all in if given the opportunity, but it\u2019s clearly not slowing Israel down any atm and the disparity between loss of Palestinian civilian lives vs Israeli is massive. It was unfathomable even before the war and innocent bodies are still mounting in Gaza, so if Hamas needs to be dismantled because of October 7th, then so does the current Israeli government, and it should have been a long time ago. I don\u2019t trust a single person in the Israeli government, it\u2019s only Israeli civilians that are giving me some semblance of hope that Israel might at one point be responsible with it\u2019s complete control over the situation, and they\u2019re a minority of Israelis from what I can tell. If you\u2019re arguing just for the dismantling of Hamas and only that, you\u2019re either naively putting too much faith in the Israeli government, or you simply have not been paying attention to their policies in Gaza and the West Bank and you simply don\u2019t care for Palestinian lives.",

And many people in the settler movement wish to resettle Gaza.\n\nThis shows a disregard for Palestinian rights and a desire to rid the land of its people for the growth of Israel. Within this context, I think you could make the argument that Israeli\u2019s actions in the war are an attempt to destroy Palestinians in whole or in part, as the destruction of the Palestinians would further Zionist goals that a significant portion of the Israeli population seems to support.\n\nAre there any holes in this argument?

To understand this, one must understand the absurdity of the israeli political spectrum\n\nIn israel, they have a political spectrum where people identify as liberals, conservatives, centrists, etc etc. So when an israeli identifies themselves as a liberal, you might assume that they have values similar to liberals in other countries. but you would be wrong.\n\nin israel, there are political positions that are so universal that they exists outside of the israeli political spectrum despite those positions automatically classifying them as far-right everywhere else in the world. the positions that \"israel should remain jewish nationalist ethnostate\" and \"all arabs are subhuman terrorists\" are a given for almost all jewish israelis. so they dont see it as a contradiction to their ideology when they espouse these ideals while also advocating for \"Social Equality and the advancement of women.\"\n\nwhy does this israeli minister for human rights think it's okay to ethnically cleanse and genocide arabs? because she doesnt consider them as human. never make the mistake of assuming an israeli is on the side of humanity unless they specifically condemn what their government is doing to palestine and to the rest of the world. they can support women and LGBT rights with one hand and genocide with the other and wont lose any sleep over it",

            "body": "Boker tov, my fellow Israelis! As a prelude, allow me to say, that this is intended as a challenging conversation, but not as a \"call out\" or an attempt at blaming anyone, or condemning Israelis and Israel of today for what happened 70+ years ago. I'm a pro-Israel Russian/Ukrainian-Israeli who arrived in the country about 2 years ago. I would describe my views as center-left, and liberal. Let's begin.   \n  \nAfter reading Benny Morris's book \"The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited\", specifically, Chapter 2 \"The idea of \u2018transfer\u2019 in Zionist thinking before 1948\", I have been faced with a lot of questions of moral character, and spent some time thinking about what Ive read there, and after. For those of you who have never read it, I highly recommend you do so, Benny is one of the most if not *the* most respected historians in Israel and offers a very balanced and informed approach to our history. I'll give a short (as short as possible) overview of what the Zionist movement thought about transferring Arabs from the land of Palestine throughout the years.   \n\n* **The end of the 19th century** and the beginning of Zionism, mainly in Theodor Herzl. The idea of transfer is rarely mentioned openly but talked about privately. This is a trend that continued all throughout the pre-1948 period, although it had slightly different reasons behind it. A few main ones remained, open talk about the transfer was thought to alienate those who were potential allies to Zionism, as well as put tension on the Arabs, who would perceive such discussion as making plans to expel them. Notably, transfer as an idea, while still in its infancy, was a real moral quandary for early Zionist leaders. Despite population transfers being considered moral, just, and rational in the time period, the idea did not sit well in the minds of Zionists, who were at the time majorly liberals and socialists. If talked about, it was always in the context of voluntary, or at the very least compensated transfer, where the Jews would buy land for the Arabs, or pay them some other way. \n* **The beginning of the 20th century** was characterized by shifts in this thinking. While many attempts to begin the voluntary transfer took place, none of them were substantial. Many of Zionist leaders preferred to still not to talk about the transfer, as more pressing matters were at hand, and one could always hope that a simple purchase of land and the following resettling of local Arabs would be satisfactory for the goals of the movement. However, spurs of Arab violence brought up the conversation, each time with more of the movement being ok with the idea of \"forceful\" transfer. \n* **1930s-1948** were, as we all know, the moment everything went down the proverbial drain. Arab violence, sporadic British limitations on Jewish immigration, and the emerging, and later raging Holocaust put Zionist leaders in a desperate position. Without many options left, and the plight of Jewish people as relevant as it ever was, or will be, the idea of forceful transfer and its necessity was all but accepted by the majority of the Jewish people in Palestine and abroad. Notably, the British and even the Arab leaders agreed with the notion (just as before, although before they agreed with an idea of voluntary transfer), that population movements were crucial for any state, be it a Jewish, or Arab one, to survive. During the civil war between the Yeshuv and the Palestinian Arabs in 1947, and the War of Independence in 1948, about 700 thousand Palestinian Arabs fled the territory that would become Israel. Some did it from sheer panic and fear of war, some were expelled by the Hagana and later IDF, who believed it impossible to establish a state with a large amount of disloyal populace, and some fled at the request of Arab leaders, who invaded in hopes of grabbing territory and, if possible, stopping the emergence of Israel. \n\nSo, knowing this history (and feel free to point out any critical mistakes I made if you find them) my questions to the sub, are this (I'll add my own answers in parentheses):\n\n1. Do you think there was, either pre or during 1947-1948, a policy (meaning a top-down, government-pushed objective) of expulsion directed at Palestinian Arabs? *(Personally, I do not see any evidence of that. Although the idea was considered inevitable, and even necessary, no such policy existed to my knowledge.)* \n2. Do you think the idea of transfer was moral for the Zionist movement to consider? Would it be more moral, or just, or practical, to follow the more left-leaning circles of the movement, and attempt to build a bi-national single state? *(I think people of the past should be judged with the standards of the historical period taken into account. Even though today the idea of forceful transfer of populations sounds incredibly inhumane and cruel to me, it was different back then, with examples like Greek-Turkish transfers improving relations and conditions of the people. Considering also that this question was a moral dilemma for early Zionism, and peaceful variations were preferred up to a point of no return, I would consider the idea morally grey, and relatively just. With how things usually go down in history, Zionist aspirations were more virtuous than almost anyone at the time. The idea of a bi-national state seems to be as an unworkable one at the time.)* \n3. Do you think the expulsion that took place during 1947-1948 was too violent, or was it simply a \"necessary evil\" during wartime? *(This is hard for me. Reading about the way the Hagana, and later IDF cleared out Arab villages is unsettling. While acts of real, sadistic cruelty are very rare and hard to find,  hundreds of thousands of people fleeing from war and terror, without many desiring to protect them, and even the peaceful Arabs faced with the reality, that the Jewish state cannot accept a large number of Arabs inside its borders, are all horrific to think about. It was a necessary evil for the creation of Israel, and considering the Holocaust, I cannot blame Jews for doing everything in their power to create a safe haven for their people.)*\n4. Would you say, that Arab resistance to this expulsion, mainly during the civil war, is justified? Do you sympathize with the plight of people displaced from territories they considered their home, irrespective of how violently they attempted to curb the process? *(Even though their methods and motivations were questionable at best, with terrorism and pogroms being commonplace, it's hard for me to claim objectivity and say that only one side in a civil war for the creation of a state is justified. Arab Palestinians fighting in a civil war against the Yeshuv were motivated by similar feelings of a desire for a state, although to a much lesser extent compared to Jews. And so, I would say, that both sides during that time had understandable justifications for what they did. I sympathize with people being displaced, as any person familiar with Jewish history should, even if those people are enemies of the Israeli state.)*\n5. Are you willing to concede, that Jewish terrorism played a major role in the establishment of Israel, whether you think of the British being targeted after imposing immigration restrictions, Arabs being targeted by Jewish militias pre-1948 during one of the many clashes between the two communities, or Arabs being targeted during the civil war in attempts to push them out of Palestine?  *(Yes, I think Jewish terrorism, while not the defining part of the movement or the military tactics it employed during 1947-1948, played its role in the creation of Israel, and it's important to not forget, or deny, this bloody and complicated history.)*\n\nI understand this post might be too long and/or heavy for people to engage with, but I'm interested in hearing your answers, thoughts, and discussion anyway. Looking back into history can give us more understanding of the present, and I hope all engagement (if any will happen lol) will be in good faith. ",

This is obviously completely impossible for 2 main reasons -\n\n1. Currently there are around 700K Israelis living in the west bank and transfering all of them out of there in a year is simply not doable. It's not like Israel has cities, houses and jobs ready to accommodate these people. The toll such a massive transfer of civilians would take on the economy and probably military is just too high for such a move to be realistic.\n\n2. Israel cannot withdraw from the west bank before it is stable enough to not be threat to Israeli security. Pulling the army out of the west bank would leave Israel's heartland completely exposed to attacks from militants within the territory, something Israel simply can't allow to happen as it would majorly compromise the country's security. This is obviously the main reason why such a hasty, one sided withdrawal is impossible. \n\nThis makes this resolution, in my opinion, detrimental to peace and not the opposite. \n\nThis is because it's a resolution that Israel simply cannot accept. The consequences of this will be that many around the world and in Palestine will have the idea that Israel continuously ignores UN resolutions reinforced and Israel will garner even more hate for it. And in Israel it feeds straight into the \"UN and everyone is anti - semitic and can't be trusted\" narrative, which only strengths and emboldens the nationalists and drives people away from peace. \nI also thinks this leads the the UN becoming less credible as what's it's point if it is pushing out unrealistic resolutions? \n\nIn my opinion if the UN truely cared about achieving peace they would adopt a resolution calling for Israel and the PA to restart earnest talks about adopting a 2 state solution, and the fact they instead adopted this one shows their interest isn't peace, but rather virtue signaling and optics. \n\nNow I know some might say that the UN general assembly resolutions are non binding and it's more about sending a message and reinforcing international law, but I would still say that sending an unrealistic message is useless and causes more harm than good.

Or a bit of both (and in which case roughly what proportion of each)?\n\nEven if intended to be within Israel, presumably the Arab population were intended (according to the UN plan) to remain?\n\nThe only territory I know for sure was emptied out by Jewish forces is West Jerusalem, I\u2019m just not sure about all the other towns/cities you hear about, not being very familiar with the geography honestly.\n\nI know there\u2019s huge debate around various other issues to do with the Nakba, I\u2019m trying to ask a question that in theory has an objective truth to it.

            "body": "Using the fact this subreddit is being bombarded by \"\"\"pro-palestinians\"\"\" to ask this. I'm an israeli. Born and rasised. Grew up Secular Jewish, quickly became Atheist. Left-wing very-active activist. Always have been, from a very young age. I must say, ever since I started seeing the shit that Ethan and Hila are enduring, I ask myself - is there even room for us in the left-wing conversation? Israelis who want peace, who act for peace, who dedicate their lives to the cause of ending the conflict, does anyone in the left care about those people? Clearly not, seeing what American Jews who don't even want to be associated with the conflict have to deal with.\n\nLike, I get that 'fuck Israel' sentiment, I probably get it better than any outsider commenting on the conflict, I do not feel like a victim. But the fact that even someone like Ethan is generalized under that same sentiment brings up a big question - do people who conduct/support this sort of behavior even care about the conflict's resolution?  \nThose of you who read all this, who aren't radical but do not understand why \"\"\"anti-zionism\"\"\" ideology such as the one that's being employed against Ethan - don't you see that it is as generalizing as any Israeli right-winger who voted and supports our god-forsaken government with the sentiment of \"fuck Hamas fuck Gazza\"?\n\nLike what about the constant streams of many many videos and photos of 400k+ civilians demonstrating in Tel Aviv and across the country for a ceasefire now?  \nWhat about the two years leading up to October 7th, where Israel was in constant governmental limbo because half the country keeps voting to have a nazi in charge (sounds familiar to Americans?) and half the country sees his win as the end of their lives as they know it- which literally did happen for a lot people? At times it felt (and still does) as if we are on the verge of a civil war.  \nDoes all that count to you people demonizing \"zionists\" or do you just watch the videos that enforce your hatred?\n\nI wrote this in a comment and was responded with a similar \"what-about\" of what about everything that's happening in Gazza, or has been happening in Palestine since the foundation of Israel and the heinous happenings of the Nakba.  \nI say we SHOULD talk about all that. You know where we talk about it? In the fucking demonstrations in Israel. Where we demonstrate, AGAINST OUR GOVERNMENT, scream our lungs out, get beaten up by police, light fires, block roads, and spend every day of the last year+ (if you read about it you'll see the demonstrations have been going non-stop for more like 3 years) and honestly fighting with MORE and MORE of our loved ones - in order to say, this needs to stop now.\n\nAs a bystander with his (wiki) feet on the ground I can say that from my view point nothing radicalized the Israeli public more than the inability of the American and Global left to include ANY fucking Israeli in the left conversation. As if **that** is the way to achieve any solution. As if \"generalizations aren't good\" only goes SO far. If you ask me this is the most extreme case of the left eating itself that I've seen in my life, literally with its own \"activism\" radicalizing and alienating the people of Israel so much that we now not only hear \"any leftie is a traitor\" in here (which has been going on for years), but also every fence sitter that ever existed knows that they would be \"naive\" for ever believing the world doesn't hate us, and if they do believe it, it must be because of auto-antisemtism (a term that was low key invented for too-radical-lefties).\n\nAnd then, when I see what happens to Ethan, I'm baffled. Maybe they're right? Maybe it's all anti-semitism? Maybe the crazy passover songs from my childhood were right and in every generation \"\"they\"\" do come to destroy \"\"us\"\"?  \nI don't actually think so. But I do see that even an AMERICAN Jew, who arguably RESCUED his Israeli wife from the fate of being born in this death-stained horrible \"\"\"holy\"\"\" land, who DONATED thousands of dollars to Palestinian organizations, is constantly and maliciously being massively harassed online for being a \"\"\"Zionist\"\"\". Do you think people who do that have any desire to have a conversation or an understanding or god forbid a POSITIVE EFFECT on anything that actually happens in the middle east, or are they all just looking around online for any public personality they know who was forced to have a bar mitzvah or has any association with a star of david, so they can use their new favorite K!ke synonym?\n\n**Edit after seeing Ethan's reaction on the show:**\n\nHi to anyone still reading this thread. I wanna just emphasize what my main point is before this thread dies off - the more Jews world wide, and by subsequent in Israel, feel genuinely scared for their lives and for the rise of anti-semtism, the easier it is for malicious and radical politicians to manipulate their fears into voting power, into support for truly vile military actions, into dehumanization and lack of empathy, into the lack of questioning to Israeli propaganda, and basically, into burying their heads in the sand regarding ANY FACT about what is tragically happening in Gaza. This is just a straight up fact. The easiest way to manipulate the common citizen in your countries as well as in mine - is FEAR.\n\nHad all this not happened, Oct 7th could easily be framed as the consequences of BB's (and the right's) policy, and masses of Israeli people would be able to turn their grief into a wake up call for PEACE NOW, SOLUTION NOW, as we try to point out every day in Israeli left circles and activism. Because of what had happened, BB and B-Gvir and Smotrich and many other vile politicians of the right who are DIRECTLY and INARGUBLY responsible for the happenings of Oct 7th (using factual proofs) are able to manipulate people's fears of anti-semitism and feed them their own spin of what needs to happen next. Or at least help them turn a blind eye towards it.\n\nYou belive in left/liberal values and want to criticize the Israeli government and military? Go off queens and kings, please, as loud as humanly possible, together.\n\nBut, in your demonstrations, if people are chanting \"from the river to the sea\", \"death to Israel\", \"death to all Jews\", or literally any other chant that could somehow be interpreted as a generalized support for peoples' death - and nobody is shocked, mad, and literally using physical means to shutting them the fuck up? (not that I support physical violence but imho it's important for the pushback to be well captured on video) - You're just shooting yourself in the goddamn foot. And by not paying attention to that, and prioritizing using active means for fighting against it, you're fucking over the cause.\n\nHonestly, I would show **active** support for all Jews/Israelis who are even willing to discuss. Not willing to do that? Then talk about the Israeli hostages (of which many are fucking peace activists who were literally kidnapped from their beds). Fight against online bullying of Jews who literally have no association with Israel, or have even shown resistance against Israel. Consider showing the strength and sincerity of your values, and also fight against instances of blunt Hamas propaganda or blunt terrorism support. And lastly, loudly speak and show acknowledgment for the very prominent sector of Israel who is against this war and all wars, and has been dedicating their lives to end it, or sadly, has been fleeing the country out of despair.\n\nPeace and de-radicalization will only ever\u00a0come\u00a0from\u00a0that. Just as we Israeli lefties know exactly how fucking important it is to acknowledge, and understand,  and research, and feel remorse for, and FIGHT against **the VAST and DEEP pain that was caused along history to the Palestinian innocents**, and continues to be caused and escalate today - you have to internalize how important it is to acknowledge the pain of your point of view's \"other side\". We are all humans. The more strict you are in **objectively** and **loudly** condemning acts of violence and injustice towards ALL people, no matter what side they're on, the more people you will be gathering behind your cause, and the more effective we all will be at saving lives. Please, just think about it, this truth is mathematical, even if you dont see it as justice, our personal justice will only ever be achieved through this understanding.\n\nI also want to add, that in my understanding there is a lot of the same shit happening within \"left\" circles regarding the Iranian resistance forces against the Iranian Islamist regime. **Elica Le Bon (@elicalebon)** who is an Iranian activist speaks about it all the time. I don't agree with everything she says and I do not feel as apologetic towards Israel, but she and many Iranian lefties are probably the strongest and loudest ally of Israeli lefties, because they recognize the power and effect of going the extra mile of being who they are (and what they represent) and showing support for the \"good\" Israelis. The more you attack people you recognize have good intentions, the more effective you are at making them your enemies, the more effective you are at harming your own cause, and subsequently harming the people of Palestine.",

I looked through each source from that post to see what the links were actually saying.\n\n>https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2013/03/palestinian-female-prisoners.html\n\nTLDR: Palestinian woman raped by an Israeli investigator in 1969. \n\n>https://www.middleeasteye.net/features/palestinian-women-haunted-abuse-israeli-jails\n\n\"Physical intimidation tactics and sexual harassment used by Israeli interrogators\" \n\n\"brushing their hands across her legs to sexually intimidate her.\"\n\nTLDR: No rape\n\n>https://mondoweiss.net/2022/08/how-colonizers-weaponize-rape-reflections-from-the-palestinian-case/\n\nTLDR: Rape in 1969 (different than first). \n\n>https://stoptorture.org.il/en/torture-in-israel-2021-situation-report/\n\nUnderwent two body cavity searches against her will. Investigation claiming rape was opened, but was closed due to \"lacking evidentiary basis\". \n\nTLDR: Court found lack of evidence. What happened is very muddy. \n\n>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0886109920978618\n\nCan't read full article, but the claims from the abstract are \"Nineteen of the 20 participants stated that they experienced some sort of unwanted verbal and nonverbal sexual comments or gestures, forced nudity, or forced touching by prison personnel.\".

And then telling him, \u2018Look, we like you,\u2019 and kicking his balls.\".\n\n>https://genderandsecurity.org/sites/default/files/Weishut_-_Sexual_Torture_of_Palestinian_M_by_Israeli_Authorities.pdf\n\nTLDR: 2 instance of rape on men (1 simulated, 1 rape with an object) between 2005-2012.\n\n>https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/conflict-and-society/9/1/arcs090105.xml?ArticleBodyColorStyles=full-text\n\nFirst bit talks about how three Human Rights Activists did investigations about rape and the IDF, and all concluded that sexual violence conducted by the IDF is limited.\n\nThe author basically questions why the number of reported sexual violence acts by the IDF against Palestinians is so low. She basically examines structures in place that make it harder and scarier for Palestinian women to come forward with their assaults. For example:\n\n\"To understand the cause of the small number of testimonies and reports disclosing sexual violence by Israeli security forces against Palestinians, we must attend to silencing structures of dependence. As shown elsewhere (Sabbagh-Khoury 2010: 177), although military rule over Palestinians living in Israel was abolished in 1966, its traumatic memory is still present in Palestinian citizens of Israel, who continue to employ self-censorship. We can only imagine what level of self-censorship is employed by Palestinians who are currently living under military rule.\"\n\n\"Sometimes, it is not enough to \u201cbelieve women\u201d to avoid silencing them. For some women, for some people, their subordination, and their dependence on certain institutions, relegates them to spaces of invisibility and silence.\"\n\nTLDR: No claims of rape.\n\n>https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/tamara-nassar/palestinian-child-says-he-was-raped-israeli-interrogator\n\n15 year old boy raped with an object by Israeli guard in 2021. Same story as the earlier link.\n\n>https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/horrific-tales-of-palestinian-girls-in-israeli-jails/2286824\n\nTLDR: \"Threats of rape\"\n\n>https://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/ngos/OMCT.pdf\n\nTLDR: \"Threats of rape\" \n\n>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_torture_in_the_occupied_territories\n\nWiki page says that \"Camp 1391, whose existence is not even officially acknowledged, claim sexual harassment, even rape, forms part of the interrogation techniques.\" The [Source](https://books.google.ca/books?id=zXxZDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT632) is from a criminal law textbook that specifically says \"Sexual humiliation and even rape are reportedly used as interrogation techniques\" with a [source](https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/01/21/the-list-the-worlds-most-notorious-prisons/) from an article. That article does not have any sources for the claim. \n\nTLDR: Rape might happen at Camp 1391. \n\n#**PART 2: Analysis**\n\nFrom the 15 links that \"proves that IDF rapes Palestinian women\":\n\n* 7 don't even claim rape. They claim either sexual harassment or threats of rape. \n\n* 3 are about events that happened in 1969 or earlier. Horrifying acts, but 50+ years ago is hardly relevant to the modern IDF. \n\n* 1 was a claim that body cavity searches that a prisoner received was rape. Was dismissed in court.\n\n* 1 that claims 2 instances of Palestinian men getting raped (1 simulated, 1 with an object). Seems credible, it uses data from [PCATI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Committee_Against_Torture_in_Israel) which is an Israeli NGO that monitors Israeli detention centers. \n\n* 1 of a wiki page that goes down a trail to an unsourced \"there might be rape happening there\" claim in reference to [Camp 1391](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_1391). \n\n* 2 are of the same story of a 15 year old boy getting raped with an object. Absolutely horrifying if it's true, but I have my doubts about the sources. I could only find information about this on two websites. https://electronicintifada.net/ which is a website created by [Ali Abunimah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Abunimah), an American Palestinian who is [\"The leading American proponent of a one-state solution to the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict\"](https://forward.com/israel/152716/lightning-rod-of-the-boycott-israel-movement/). His [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/AliAbunimah) makes it pretty clear that he's got some pretty heavy anti-Israel bias. He tweets some unhinged shit: [1](https://twitter.com/AliAbunimah/status/1710610208622309852) [2](https://twitter.com/AliAbunimah/status/1710938576924357087) [3](https://twitter.com/AliAbunimah/status/1711321896728383927) [4](https://twitter.com/AliAbunimah/status/1711323398293307554) [5](https://twitter.com/AliAbunimah/status/1712638360471171517). The other source is [Defense for Children Palestine](https://www.dci-palestine.org/) which was [designated as a terrorist organization](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2021-10-22/ty-article/.premium/gantz-declares-six-palestinian-ngos-terrorist-organizations/0000017f-e795-dea7-adff-f7ff13bf0000) in 2021 by Israel. There seems to be a lack of evidence for this claim, but at best the DCI-P source is probably pretty heavily biased. I'm extremely doubtful that this story is real. \n\nThis compilation of links is clearly an attempt to overload readers with information. 99% of people won't read any of the articles (let alone all of them) and will just see some spooky looking headlines. The intention is pretty clearly designed to illicit a reaction of \"holy shit look how many links there are, this must be true and severe\". The OP even says [\"I found this out in, like, five minutes.\"](https://i.imgur.com/aYxNxDF.png) to try to make a point how clear and obvious it is, but ironically they solidified the point that they just read and shared 15 headlines without actually reading the articles. \n\nThis isn't even to say that IDF soldiers don't rape. It's possible that the IDF keeps a complete tight seal and just completely gags any report of rape. There was the instance of [the gag order on a soldier convicted of rape](https://www.timesofisrael.com/ending-censorship-idf-admits-officer-jailed-in-2017-raped-a-palestinian-woman/) so it's certainly possible that there are more similar instances. I just think supporting your argument with \"well it's probably happening, we just don't know because of gag orders\" is incredibly weak and that seems to be what Hasan left the episode saying. \n\nFrom my time spent on this, it is actually crazy how little rape or sexual violence Israel seems to use. Again, it's possible that it's all under gag orders and that it's systemic, but given the lack of evidence it's tough to believe. Given the animosity between both sides, if Israelis were systemically raping Palestinians, I'd be inclined to believe that the Palestinians would want people to know. [This link](https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/conflict-and-society/9/1/arcs090105.xml?ArticleBodyColorStyles=full-text#bib47) that they posted is ironically a silver bullet to counter the claims that rape is well documented. The essay examines why rape claims against the IDF are so low. They basically conclude that if rape is occurring, systemic barriers may make it hard for Palestinian women to come forward. \n\nSo no Hasan (and Hasan fans) the IDF raping Palestinian women is absolutely not a \"well documented part of Israeli's apartheid apparatus\". Not that any of them will read this, this is more aimed at encouraging this community to actually read articles that people link, because very often it doesn't support what they're trying to argue. \n\nTLDR: Hasan's community tries to prove that IDF is raping Palestinian women with 15 sources. None of their sources support the argument that the IDF is currently raping Palestinian women.",

It also explains a lot about why we are still fighting today. In their culture, shame/honor trump rational/reasonable any day.\n\nIn the 1948 war that Israel won - it was absolutely unthinkable that dhimmis could have beaten Arabs...so...\n\n\"Instead, in a state of intense humiliation and impotence on the world stage, the Arab leadership chose denial\u2014the Jews *did* not, *could* not, *have* not won. The war was not\u2014could never\u2014be over until victory. If the refugees (NB: Palestinians) from this Zionist aggression disappeared, absorbed by their brethren in the lands to which they fled, this would acknowledge the intolerable: that Israel *had* won. \n\nAnd so, driven by rage and denial, the Arab honor group redoubled the catastrophe of its own refugees: They made them suffer in camps, frozen in time at the moment of the humiliation, waiting and fighting to reverse that Zionist victory that could not be acknowledged. The continued suffering of these sacrificial victims on the altar of Arab pride called out to the Arab world for vengeance against the Jews. In the meantime, wherever Muslims held power, they drove their Jews out as a preliminary act of revenge.\"\n\n\"Even among the most Westernized Arabs, the wound of Israel\u2019s existence cuts deep, as does the instinct to accuse Israel for Arab failures. Ahmed Sheikh, editor in chief of Al Jazeera, [blames Israel](http://www.theaugeanstables.com/2006/12/08/why-israels-existence-prevents-arab-democracy/) for the lack of democracy in the Arab world:\n\n>The day when Israel was founded created the basis for our problems. \u2026 It\u2019s because we always lose to Israel. It gnaws at the people in the Middle East that such a small country as Israel, with only about 7 million inhabitants, can defeat the Arab nation with its 350 million. That hurts our collective ego. The Palestinian problem is in the genes of every Arab. The West\u2019s problem is that it does not understand this.\n\n [Why the Arab World Is Lost in an Emotional Nakba, and How We Keep It There - Tablet Magazine](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/israel-middle-east/articles/emotional-nakba) ",

For three it will immediately put any zionist on a moral backfooting thats near impossible to come back from.\n\n",

That thing is glorious. Actually Dooku in animation has an amazing one, but in real life is a bit disappointing. Young Obi Wan gets my most improved look. Him between Episodes 1 and 2 is a huge improvement. ",

            "body": "Hi there, I recently caught my neighbor bringing her grandchildren over to my front yard to play with my Halloween decorations. I went out and asked if they need something, and explained that we had just planted grass and would appreciate it if they stayed off the yard. She had my number beforehand and could've asked for permission and I would've said \"not until the grass matures.\" I was very friendly in the interaction, but got the NASTIEST text from her after. She threatened me, saying they have every right to play in it because they own it. I sent her the survey saying they clearly do not own it and now she's starting a neighbor war. I did nothing wrong here, advice? My plan is to just ignore her.\n\nEDIT: no front yard fences here. I wish it were that easy! \n\nEdit 2: wow, thanks for all your responses. To sum up all of your ideas: \n\n- Hit them with the sprinklers (I might actually do this) \n- Plant bushes (I like gardening, so I might do this too) \n- FIRE ANTS (no elaboration was provided but I like the spirit!) \n\nSome not so great ideas: \n\n- Let them keep \"their\" yard and be agreeable to a lawsuit when the kids inevitably get hurt \n- Never decorate or landscape again. It's their right to use the land if they like how it looks, so never do anything that looks nice \n- BUILD A FENCE that will cost a lot to install and take a lot of time to take down when I am cited by the city. I'm not sure why none of you believe the part of my post about \"no fences\" \n- shoot them (I mean, this IS Texas so maybe I should....) \n\nAnd a personal favorite: \n\nNSFW, graphic pumpkin man decor. I'll do that next year. \n\nUPDATE: Nothing had happened since I posted, so I assumed she got over her little hissy fit. Today, I got home and there was TONS of crap on my lawn. She's doing a major renovation and told her contractors to set up shop in my yard. There are 2 miter saws, about a dozen buckets of paint, mortar, etc., and various piles of flooring on my lawn. A truck is parked in my yard. I politely asked them to move their stuff to her yard and they said she told them she owns my yard. I called the police. Hopefully this is the end of her shenanigans. \n\n",

Not every planet is equally open and large, but each one looks incredibly beautiful and captures the Star Wars atmosphere that fans love so much. The AI and occasional bugs do take you out of the immersion and the story is not outstanding apart from the characters, but we still couldn't get enough of Kay, Nix, ND-5 and the many planets. Just beware of the addictive potential of the card game Sabacc.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Checkpoint Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/563/checkpoint-gaming)** - [Tom Quirk](https://opencritic.com/critic/6050/tom-quirk) - [8 / 10](https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2024/08/star-wars-outlaws-review-the-canto-job/)\n\n>I found myself very pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed Star Wars Outlaws. I became quite invested in its grounded heist narrative, even if its supporting characters didn't really rise above one-note stereotypes. It was a blast exploring the Star Wars galaxy, whether it was shooting down TIE fighters in space or just chilling in a Sabacc den playing cards with Lando Calrissian. Ubisoft Massive has done an excellent job in crafting an open-world Star Wars adventure, and this is one heist that is worth signing up for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Patrick Tremblay](https://opencritic.com/critic/9708/patrick-tremblay) - [Recommended](https://www.consolecreatures.com/review-star-wars-outlaws/)\n\n>Star Wars Outlaws delivers one of Ubisoft's best games in years.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Destructoid](https://opencritic.com/outlet/90/destructoid)** - [Steven Mills](https://opencritic.com/critic/10000/steven-mills) - [Unscored](https://www.destructoid.com/review-in-progress-star-wars-outlaws/)\n\n>If you enjoy the Ubisoft structure of games but have been overwhelmed by them lately, thankfully Outlaws avoids most of the pitfalls. I feel safe in recommending Star Wars Outlaws to anyone who is a Star Wars fan who is looking for a solid story in the beloved universe, with stealth-focused gameplay that allows you to truly live the life of a scoundrel on the Outer Rim.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Evilgamerz](https://opencritic.com/outlet/878/evilgamerz)** - [Daan Nijboer](https://opencritic.com/critic/10035/daan-nijboer) - *Dutch* - [8 / 10](https://evilgamerz.com/star-wars-outlaws/)\n\n>As a Star Wars fan, judging Outlaws is quite a difficult task. Very objectively speaking, there is still plenty to criticize about this game. Technically and in terms of gameplay it is really not high quality. The combat in particular is a bit too basic for the year 2024. Explosions seem to come from 2010 and we have also seen better facial animations. Then it is very doubtful that a paid season pass has been added where more missions will be playable later. Of course, you don't have to purchase this, but content in a single-player game that is behind a paywall is never desirable. But, and a really big but, as a Star Wars fan it is simply a pleasure to finally travel around and discover the open world of Tatooine and the other plants. These planets have been designed with so much love that it is a pleasure to comb every meter. There is a bizarre amount to do outside the storyline, without it becoming boring. Kay as the main character won't reach Kratos or Ellie status, but is fun enough. Together with Nix and ND-5 there is enough interaction to enjoy following the various conversations. Don't expect a groundbreaking game from Star Wars Outlaws, but fans will enjoy it from start to finish. Outlaws is not finished to perfection and it all feels a bit clumsy, but that gives exactly the right Star Wars feeling of the original trilogy.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [Benjamin Braun](https://opencritic.com/critic/4867/benjamin-braun) - *German* - [85%](https://www.games.ch/star-wars-outlaws/test/review-lhgu/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamePro](https://opencritic.com/outlet/488/gamepro)** - [Dennis Michel](https://opencritic.com/critic/5703/dennis-michel) - *German* - [85 / 100](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/star-wars-outlaws-test,3418529.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameblog](https://opencritic.com/outlet/450/gameblog)** - *French* - [8 / 10](\n        https://www.gameblog.fr/jeu-video/jeux/tests/star-wars-outlaws-test-pc-600797)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamefa](https://opencritic.com/outlet/498/gamefa)** - [Mostafa Zahedi](https://opencritic.com/critic/5596/mostafa-zahedi) - *Persian* - [8 / 10](https://gamefa.com/1059614/star-wars-outlaws-review/)\n\n>Star Wars Outlaws is an entertaining game from start to finish that delivers an amazing gunplay, beautiful world and ample content.

From features that aren\u2019t fully fleshed out to boring missions and mechanics that make absolutely no sense, it\u2019s a smorgasbord of startling mistakes and questionable design decisions that will leave anyone, Star Wars fan or not, reeling.

The decision not to choose a Jedi as the main character brings a breath of fresh air to the game. However, a certain monotony becomes apparent after a while. Although the gameplay is very entertaining, there is a lack of innovation and challenges. For fans of the universe and anyone looking for a well-told single-player story, Star Wars Outlaws is still an adventure worth recommending, even if it does seem a little monotonous in some aspects.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamingTrend](https://opencritic.com/outlet/102/gamingtrend)** - [David Burdette](https://opencritic.com/critic/7590/david-burdette) - [85 / 100](https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review-a-scoundrels-tale/)\n\n>Star Wars Outlaws might play things a bit safe, but the solid foundation leads to a fantastic adventure.

While Star Wars Outlaws won't be turning heads or wowing anyone with its gameplay mechanics, the painstaking amount of effort and detail into bringing the Star Wars underworld to life must be commended. It's a game any Star Wars fan should pick up, even if it doesn't have lightsabers or Jedi.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Nexus Hub](https://opencritic.com/outlet/528/nexus-hub)** - Ryan Pretorius - [7.5 / 10](https://nexushub.co.za/nexus/review-star-wars-outlaws.html)\n\n>Star Wars Outlaws will appeal to die-hard fans looking for a new world-hopping adventure loaded with charm and all-too-familiar gameplay, but it can't escape bothersome performance issues and a weak protagonist.\n\n-------------\n\n**[One More Game](https://opencritic.com/outlet/811/one-more-game)** - [Chris Garcia](https://opencritic.com/critic/8410/chris-garcia) - [8.5 / 10](https://onemoregame.ph/2024/08/star-wars-outlaws-review/)\n\n>Star Wars Outlaws is a surprisingly good time, and I have to say that I enjoyed the game more than I thought I would after playing it early in previews. The scoundrel's life is well realized, and playing Kay Vess through her escapades was a pleasure because of her charm and character.

I was walking down the dusty streets of Mos Eisley, past the hanger where the Millenium Falcon would have been parked up. Walking into the cantina and spotting the blaster mark on the wall which confirmed who shot first. Lots of little details make this visit to the galaxy far far away one of the most memorable of the last couple of years, but these cities felt real in a way I've never experience before, teeming and lived in, this open world game from Ubisoft's Massive Entertainment feels expansive and intimate at the same time.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Saudi Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/455/saudi-gamer)** - *Arabic* - [7 / 10](https://www.saudigamer.com/review/star-wars-outlaws/)\n\n>Star Wars Outlaws could have been THE Star War game.

Star Wars Outlaws does a lot of things, and at no point does it fumble with its ambition, and executes on it with truly epic moments, fun stealth, and freedom of choice. Massive Entertainment really knows how to make their game worlds feel lived in, and there\u2019s no better setting than Star Wars, especially during the latter episodes of the original trilogy. Star Wars Outlaws works so well because it epitomizes what Han Solo says, \u201cHokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.\u201d\n\n-------------\n\n**[Seasoned Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/451/seasoned-gaming)** - [Alex Segovia](https://opencritic.com/critic/9737/alex-segovia) - [8 / 10](https://seasonedgaming.com/2024/08/26/review-star-wars-outlaws-scrappy-nerf-herder/)\n\n>While far from flawless, Outlaws proves that the ultimate fulfillment of the Star Wars game we\u2019ve dreamed of is within our grasp.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Shacknews](https://opencritic.com/outlet/62/shacknews)** - [Bill Lavoy](https://opencritic.com/critic/4456/bill-lavoy) - [8 / 10](https://www.shacknews.com/article/141136/star-wars-outlaws-review-score)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Sirus Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/409/sirus-gaming)** - [Lexuzze Tablante](https://opencritic.com/critic/1871/lexuzze-tablante) - [10 / 10](https://sirusgaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-review/)\n\n>Star Wars Outlaws\u2019 impressive characters, staggering world-building, hooking story, amazing soundtrack, and engaging gameplay, make this the first authentic open-world experience that every Star Wars fan deserves.

The rep system in particular is interesting, as the constant fluctuations belie any kind of loyalty you might show otherwise, but most importantly, this game lets you just be in the enduring Star Wars Universe. It's not perfect, but stealing for crime syndicates, fighting the Empire, speeding across alien landscapes, and so much more is a dream come true.\n\n-------------\n\n**[VGC](https://opencritic.com/outlet/821/vgc)** - [Jordan Middler](https://opencritic.com/critic/8444/jordan-middler) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/star-wars-outlaws/)\n\n>Star Wars Outlaws is a pulpy, Uncharted-style adventure that doesn't quite fulfil its potential. Kay and Nix lead a great cast through a well-paced, punchy story, but the game's Reputation system, and syndacite storyline in general feels undercooked.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Vamers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/761/vamers)** - [Edward Swardt](https://opencritic.com/critic/7464/edward-swardt) - [Essential](https://vamers.com/2024/08/26/star-wars-outlaws-review/)\n\n>Whether players are die-hard fans of the franchise or newcomers looking for an entry point, Star Wars Outlaws truly is something special. It rewards curiosity, encourages exploration, and makes players feel like a true part of the galaxy far, far away. Navigating Kay Vess\u2019s journey does not just feel like playing a game; it allows players to feel like they are actively living in a Star Wars story, one choice at a time. In that sense, Star Wars Outlaws does not just meet expectations; it joins the ranks of Jedi: Survivor and Knights of the Old Republic II as it sets a new standard for what an open-world Star Wars game can and should be.\n\n-------------\n\n**[WellPlayed](https://opencritic.com/outlet/382/wellplayed)** - [Adam Ryan](https://opencritic.com/critic/5704/adam-ryan) - [7 / 10](https://www.well-played.com.au/star-wars-outlaws-review/)\n\n>Mechanically speaking, Star Wars Outlaws isn't going to throw you into hyperspace, but, despite its lack of innovation, there is still plenty of fun to be had within its beautifully crafted worlds.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XboxEra](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera)** - [Jesse Norris](https://opencritic.com/critic/7583/jesse-norris) - [8 / 10](https://xboxera.com/2024/08/26/star-wars-outlaws-review-in-progress/)\n\n>STAR WARS Outlaws is the dream 3rd-person open world title so many of us wanted.\u00a0 It\u2019s big, and fun, and while it has some flaws I have greatly enjoyed my time with it.\u00a0 A massive progression blocking soft-lock is a bit of a bummer and instead of this being a final score it\u2019s going to be a review-in-progress one as I wait to see the rest of the title once it\u2019s fixed.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ZdobywcyGier.eu](https://opencritic.com/outlet/869/zdobywcygier-eu)** - [Pawe\u0142 Bortkiewicz](https://opencritic.com/critic/9940/pawe-bortkiewicz) - *Polish* - [7.5 / 10](https://zdobywcygier.eu/wp/2024/08/26/star-wars-outlaws-recenzja/)\n\n>Star Wars Outlaws is a pretty good game with no shortage of flaws. At first glance it seems very impressive, but after a long time many systems begin to tire the player. The plot is an element that will probably divide fans, as there is a lack of interesting characters here, but the story idea itself is quite good. Nevertheless, if you are a fan of Star Wars then most likely you will still want to get acquainted with another story from this universe.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Zoomg](https://opencritic.com/outlet/478/zoomg)** - [Ali Goodarzi](https://opencritic.com/critic/7669/ali-goodarzi) - *Persian* - [7.5 / 10](https://www.zoomg.ir/game-review/370985-star-wars-outlaws-review/)\n\n>Star Wars Outlaws is a compact, charming, and highly entertaining open-world video game. Despite some issues, I recommend it to fans of story-driven open-world games. Ubisoft Massive\u2019s new game breaks away from the routine patterns of Assassin\u2019s Creed or Far Cry and draws inspiration from other well-tested games in this genre. Overall, Star Wars Outlaws is a game that both Star Wars fans and Open World game enthusiasts will enjoy playing.\n\n-------------",

Lebanon would have never been destroyed and there wouldn't be a war. Natanyahu was so persistent to continue the genocide, he doesn't care about the hostages and even israelis know that. This small decision would have avoided so many things. There is only the israeli government to blame after everything that happened after oct 9. ",

Yet, like many other of their arguments, usually it lack the depth of understanding the implication.\n\n\n\n**Just Stop Fighting**\n\n Basically it means just stopping the current fighting. It means that Hamas stays in Power; it means that the hostages are not released. Then, Israel must remain highly alert and respond to any potential threats, planning, or attempts similar to the  7th of October. It also means, from the Israeli point of view, that any response should be highly aggressive to make sure it stays safe.\n\n\n\n**Bringing in a Peacekeeping Force:**\n\nFor me, this sounds like science fiction: Let's bring an international peacekeeping force. Who would be willing and able to take on this role? We have seen that Spanish Politicians supporting Palestine are not even willing to move to Ramallah; how many would be willing to fight and risk their lives here? Even  Arab countries have shown reluctance to get involved directly. So, who will be the soldiers on the ground if you like this option? \n\n\n\n**The Hostages Issue:**\n\nOne of the main points that are ignored (by pro-pals) about the ceasefire is the hostages. Usually, it involves a comparison that is behind evil: People (Gazans / West Bank people) who were involved in planning and executing attacks on civilians cannot be equal to those who were simply attending a party and were kidnapped.\n\n\n\nThere are many more points, but I wanted to bring the main ones to start the discussion and show the problems in the commonly proposed ideas. \n\nSo, if you are pal, which ceasefire can you offer that will also satisfy Israel's needs?

Going into Oct 7 anyone with half a brain knew that Hamas would not stand a chance against the IDF. Their strategy always was to pile up enough dead bodies in front of the camera for western liberals to start feeling guilty and call on the IDF to stop. The only way Hamas actually wins is if the western liberals save them. If this conflict for example ends with a ceasefire where the hostages are still in the hands of Hamas or no admission of defeat is coming from Hamas then Hamas wins. \n\nThe refrain is always couldn't Israel have done another approach? You hear this because western liberals are unable to empathize with Israelis. They are surrounded by other western liberal countries which would not have minded a softer approach. In the area of the world Israel is in it would have been taken as a sign of weakness and invited further attacks from Lebanon and other countries. \n\nThe second refrain is how many dead children are enough? The answer is as many as it takes for Hamas to give up. If hamas surrenders and unilaterally releases the hostages this can all stop. Notice that no demands are ever made of Hamas. Despite being the democratically elected government of Gaza they are not asked to share supplies with their populace, they are not asked to defend their populace, they are not asked to make concessions to end a war that is hurting their populace. Instead the onus of everything is on Israel. Despite suffering the Oct 7 massacre Israel is expected to make sure the Gazans are supplied, not harmed unduly, and Israel is asked to stop attacking out of the goodness of their own hearts. \n\nPay attention to the western liberals. Not one of them will ask anything uncomfortable of Hamas. The fact that the demands are made entirely on Israel shows you which side they actually support.\n\nA special carveout does go to the families of hostages though. You support a ceasefire because you are worried about getting your family members back. I do have to remind you. As far as I am aware the last time Israel had to negotiate a hostage release without accompanying military action it took 6 years. And not just  6 quiet years either. It was 6 years of is he alive or not alive? Do you want proof? Well you have to pay. 6 years of an emotional trauma as the Palestinians play with your emotions. Now there are 240 hostages. Are you truly willing to go thru a process that may take decades to see your family members again? To be perfectly blunt some families may opt to pull the trigger themselves rather than to put their loved ones and themselves thru that.",

For those of you out of the loop, there\u2019s a rift happening on TikTok between Black Americans and Pro Palestine Activists. Some of the top activist accounts have been harassing black voters who do show solidarity and want to vote for Kamala, to NOT vote at all. As a Black American voter myself, I\u2019m disgusted how a lot of these activists have shown their true colors by only using us as tools for their movement at the cost of our civil rights. It\u2019s been proven time and time again that Republicans have always had the advantage in low voter turnout. A no vote is a vote for Trump. With the DNC next week, no matter how many times Biden, Harris, Walz, Obama, etc. discuss the ceasefire, these activists will still not be satisfied. I\u2019m honestly a bit desensitized from most of the Pro Palestine Movement. It\u2019s extremely unfortunate what\u2019s happening over there, but if Trump wins, it\u2019ll be worst for BOTH Palestine and America.",

As working people, we stand with the oppressed and the innocent, thousands of whom have lost their lives in the last month.\n\nAs a union that stands for equality, social justice, human and labor rights, and international solidarity, we unite with unions and people of goodwill around the world in calls for justice and peace.\n\nWe unreservedly condemn the Hamas violence of October 7, which killed over 1,000 Israeli civilians and saw the kidnapping of more than 200 people.\n\nHowever, Israel\u2019s response has made the prospects for peace more remote. Over 10,000 innocent civilians, including 4000 children, have been killed by the relentless and indiscriminate bombing campaign on Gaza. Israel has shut off the flow of food, water, fuel and medical supplies to the Gaza Strip, a war crime. A humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding every day in Gaza. Thousands more innocent civilians stand to die wholly preventable deaths.\n\nWe call on our government, which is the primary foreign benefactor of the Israeli government, to use all its power to protect innocent lives and to help bring about peace in the region, and not use our tax dollars for more war.\n\nWe join the calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of hostages, and urgently needed massive humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza. The cries of humanity demand nothing less.\n\nAPWU General Officers: President, Mark Dimondstein; Executive Vice President, Debby Szeredy; Secretary-Treasurer, Elizabeth 'Liz' Powell\n\nLink to the statement: https://apwu.org/news/international/statement-apwu-general-officers-conflict-israel-and-palestine",

Peace is what we\u2019re fighting for\u201d and \u201cEnd the genocide.\u201d \n\nSince November, MU student groups have held weekly demonstrations to protest the thousands of civilians killed and injured in Gaza from Israeli attacks, which were launched after Hamas terrorists killed 1,200 Israeli citizens and captured hundreds. Monday\u2019s protest was the biggest by far.\n\nThe demonstration was organized by a coalition of five student organizations. The 90-minute protest ended with speeches by a few of the organizers.\n\n\u201dAs students, we learn about history in the hopes that we can make sure that it doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but we also need to acknowledge that student activism is an integral part of American history,\u201d said Lima Sherzad, president of Mizzou Muslim Students\u2019 Organization. \u201cAnd change did not come easy; speaking out against injustices was not easy. Yet the students showed up time and time again. And there is where we need to draw our energy and momentum from. Each of us have a responsibility towards the people of Gaza and Palestinian to raise our voices and protest this brutal onslaught.\u201d\n\nIan De Smet, co-chair of the Mizzou Young Democratic Socialists of America, stressed the power of gathering for a common effort. He urged students to stay active in local efforts as summer begins and students return home.\n\n\u201cThose bombs dropping on Gaza, they have the seal of the United States government, and we, as citizens, have the responsibility and the power to stand up,\u201d De Smet said.\n\nOrganizers scheduled Monday\u2019s demonstration on a weekday and encouraged students to walk out of class to participate, compared to the weekly protests on Saturdays.\n\nProtests have proliferated across U.S. universities, including high-profile events at Columbia University, Yale University, the University of Texas at Austin, Emory University and the University of Southern California. Tensions have risen, and some of these demonstrations have been met with police action, arrests and student suspensions. On Monday afternoon, police arrested more than 100 protestors at Washington University in St. Louis. Local protest organizers said they wanted to ensure that Monday\u2019s demonstration was peaceful.\n\nMizzou Students for Justice in Palestine has helped organize Columbia\u2019s weekly protests and plan Monday\u2019s walkout.\n\nMSJP worked with university officials to ensure the protest remained peaceful. MU spokesperson Christian Basi said administrators and organizers talked through logistics, such as specifying the route the march took and ensuring that marchers stayed on sidewalks to maintain a safe event.\n\nSuch protests highlight a difficult challenge for colleges: they need to be places where students can freely share ideas while also keeping everyone safe.\n\nAfter the MU campus was roiled in 2015 by student protests of racial acts and insensitivity, the university modified some policies concerning protests and created new policies, such as a policy requiring permits for sound amplification.\n\nBut more than just creating policies, Basi said, \u201cwe were adamant about changing our interactions with student groups. That was very much on display today,\u201d he said. The university has \u201chad very positive conversations with student groups.\n\n\u201cWhile the university does not endorse a particular viewpoint of anyone on the campus or any student group, by being in contact with us, we were able to make sure that they were aware of all of our policies as well as our procedures and provide them with some information to ensure their event could go off smoothly and without a hitch,\u201d Basi said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what happened today.\u201d\n\nMSJP\u2019s Isleen Atallah said the conflict in Gaza is a local issue. \u201cThe situation in Palestine is not just a distant conflict; it\u2019s a humanitarian crisis that demands global attention,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are here to remind our community and the world that peace is possible, but it requires action from all of us.\u201d\n\nMU junior Sanya Suri said she came to Monday\u2019s walkout to speak out on behalf of the innocent people in Palestine. \u201cEveryone deserves peace. Everyone deserves their own land. Everyone deserves access to food, water, and education,\u201d Suri said. \u201cEveryone honestly just deserves to be treated like a human being, and that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening right now,\u201d Suri said she tries to attend the Saturday protests when she can as well.\n\nMichael Volz, faculty advisor for MSJP, said he was glad students had the freedom to express their concerns about what is happening in Gaza.\n\n\u201cSpeaking for myself and not the university, my hope is that people who come here will continue to write to their political leaders and to speak out in the hopes that we hold the U.S. government accountable,\u201d said Volz, an associate professor of Chinese and director of MU\u2019s International Studies Program.\n\nThe conflict escalated following an attack by Hamas on October 7, 2023, which killed at least 1,200 people in Israel, according to CNN. That prompted intense military attacks by Israel across Gaza, affecting hospitals, residential areas, and critical infrastructure. As of the latest reports by Al Jazeera, the death toll in Gaza stands at 34,979 Palestinians, including more than 14,500 children and 8,400 women. Additionally, over 77,643 people have been injured, and more than 8,000 are missing.\n\nThe significant destruction to Gaza\u2019s infrastructure has had a profound humanitarian impact. More than half of Gaza\u2019s homes, 360,000 residential units, have been either destroyed or damaged. Educational facilities, hospitals, places of worship, and vital water sources have also suffered extensive damage. The ongoing conflict has increased the challenges faced by the people of Gaza, who have been living under a blockade since 2007, restricting the movement of goods and people and severely limiting access to basic services.\n\nRasha Abousalem, a humanitarian aid worker and MU adjunct professor discussed the challenges of delivering aid in Gaza. \u201cOnce it reaches those checkpoints and it\u2019s transferred from Egyptian trucks into Palestinian trucks, a lot of the aid...is damaged. Some of the aid is taken, and then, after several days, to enter into the warehouses, then you have the issue of people, some groups, taking it inside Gaza and selling it on the black market,\u201d Abousalem said.\n\nNoah Citron, a community member who is part of Columbia Jews for Ceasefire, said several members of the organization were in attendance.\n\n\u201cI have been seeing a lot in the media that Jews, portrayed as a single voice, are not feeling safe at events like this. Personally, as a Jew, I felt perfectly safe,\u201d Citron said. \u201cThere was not one moment where I felt unsafe around anyone attending this protest.\u201d\n\nCitron said the protest taking place during one of the last days of Passover was particularly timely.\n\n\u201cEvery year, we talk about how the Jewish people\u2019s story of Passover kind of represents all people who are oppressed. And so I feel like this is so timely to be talking about.\u201d",

Additionally, a number of tunnel shafts were located and destroyed.\n\nIDF intelligence identified a regional UNRWA clinic that had been taken over by terrorists and turned into a weapons storage facility and a hideout for terrorists in the area. The terrorists who had barricaded themselves in the clinic fired at the troops and were eliminated. Additionally, directed by IAF aircraft, the soldiers eliminated a terrorist cell that fired at them from within the clinic. Following the elimination of the terrorists, numerous secondary explosions were observed, indicating a hidden weapons stockpile.",

US and Israeli intelligence both also report that in addition to the Hamas dead, thousands of other soldiers have been wounded, although they disagree on the severity of these wounds with Israeli intelligence believing most will not return to the battlefield while American intel suggests many eventually will. Hamas are widely reported to have had 25,000-30,000 fighters at the start of the war.\n\nAnother interesting point from the Reuters piece is that Israeli military chiefs and intelligence believe that an invasion of Rafah would mean 6-8 more weeks in total of full scale military operations, after which Hamas would be decimated to the point where they could shift to a lower intensity phase of targeted airstrikes and special forces operations that weed out fighters that slipped through the cracks or are trying to cobble together control in areas the Israeli army has since cleared in the North.\n\nHow do you think this information should shape Israeli's response and next steps? Should they look to move in on Rafah, take out as much of what's left of Hamas as possible and move to targeted airstrikes and Mossad ops to take out remaining fighters on a smaller scale? Should they be wary of international pressure building against a strike on Rafah considering it is the last remaining stronghold in the South and where the majority of Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip have gathered, perhaps moving to surgical strikes and special ops against key threats from here without a full invasion? Or should they see this as enough damage done to Hamas in general and move for a ceasefire? What are your thoughts?",

It is obviously a symbol of colonization though because it was built on top of somebody else's place of worship and its existence has been used to justify continued control over that land. Even today non-Muslims aren't allowed to go there most of the time.\n\nI don't see it as being any different than the Spanish coming to the Americas and building cathedrals on top of their places of worship as a mechanism to spread their faith and culture. [The Spanish built a cathedral in Cholula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iglesia_de_Nuestra_Se\u00f1ora_de_los_Remedios,_Cholula#:~:text=The%20Iglesia%20de%20Nuestra%20Se\u00f1ora,central%20Mexican%20state%20of%20Puebla), for example, directly on top of one of the worlds largest pyramids. I don't see how this is any different than Muslims building the Al Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock on top of the Temple Mount.\n\nNot sure what would change my mind but quite frankly I don't want to see things this way. It just seems to be an unfortunate truth that many people aren't willing to see because of the current state of affairs.\n\nFYI: Any comments about how Zionists are the real colonizers or anything else like that are going to be ignored. That's not what this is about.\n\n  \nEdit: I see a few people saying that since Islam isn't a country it doesn't count. Colonization isn't necessarily just a nation building a community somewhere to take its resources. Colonization also comes in the form of spreading culture and religious views. The fact that you can find a McDonalds in ancient cities across the world and there has been nearly global adoption of capitalism are good examples of how propagating ones society is about more than land acquisition.

Most Israeli Jews have zero interest in resuming the animal sacrifices of the 1st century.\n\nMost Israeli Jews would love to have a synagogue on Temple Mount for praying - but there's already plenty of room to build one! There is an empty space on Temple Mount to the east of Al-Aqsa large enough to build a synagogue the size of the Pantheon.\n\nIn Alt Neuland, the foundational text of Zionism, Herzl envisions a Third Temple - but not on top on the Foundation Stone, and without the priestly rites of 2,000 years ago. In other words, simply an exceptional and holy synagogue.\n\n  \nIf Al-Aqsa Mosque magically ascended into the sky tomorrow, and the Clerics of the Waqf ruled that this was the will of God and it would not be rebuilt - most Israeli Jews would oppose the restoration of 2nd Temple Judaism and all its rituals.\n\nSecular Jews have no interest in a priestly caste performing animal sacrifices. Ultra-Orthodox Jews, already skeptical of the Israeli state, believe that the Third Temple will only be built in the Messianic Age, and will oppose any human attempts to build it today.\n\nOnly a fraction of Religious Nationalists would support its rebuilding. These voices - people like Smotrich - are a small, but very vocal and publicized minority of Israel's populace and politics.\n\n  \nIf Al-Aqsa magically disappeared and the Muslim world greenlit all Jewish construction on Temple Mount, likely less than 15/120 members of the Knesset would vote for a Third Temple. The overwhelming majority - including Netanyahu and his Ultra-Orthodox allies - would vote against it.\n\nSo unless you feel threatened by the mere coexistence of Jewish and Islamic prayer in their mutual holy site, this is a manufactroversy. Not only do Israelis not want to destroy Al-Aqsa for their Third Temple, most don't want a Third Temple in the first place.",

            "body": "Procrastination is the thief of time and I have idly spent the last few hours disappearing down different rabbit holes following odd facts and bits of useless information. I\u2019m sure many of you will have spent hours looking for one thing, only to be led way off track and find another. On this occasion, all was not in vain, because I have come to learn about a remarkable Turkish man whose sense of duty to God and Al-Aqsa needs to be shared with everyone.\n\nI have often said that the only reason that the Noble Sanctuary of Al-Aqsa Mosque is still standing is because of the heroic resistance of the Palestinian people who\u2019ve given their lives to protect Islam\u2019s third holiest site from the Israeli occupation forces.\n\nHowever, there is at least one other person who should be singled out for helping in this noble cause. Corporal Hasan Al-Aghdarli devoted more than six decades of his life guarding Al-Aqsa and protecting it from those who would do it harm. I came across his inspirational story in a news item on TRT World which I think deserves a much wider audience.\n\nCorporal Hasan was the last soldier from the Ottoman Empire deployed to guard Al-Aqsa Mosque until his dying days. The First World War veteran from Turkiye\u2019s Igdir province was part of the heavy machine gun team of the Ottoman Army that was deployed to guard Jerusalem. The last orders he received from his senior officer were obeyed to the letter, and he stood guard at Al-Aqsa Mosque for 65 years until his death in 1982.\n\nWe would never have known about his remarkable service had it not been for the curiosity of the late Turkish journalist Ilhan Bardakci, who accompanied Turkish officials and businessmen on a courtesy visit to the sanctuary in 1972. \u201cI felt thrilled while climbing to the upstairs of the sacred mosque. They call the upstairs courtyard \u201812,000 chandelier courtyard\u2019 where Yavuz Sultan Selim lit 12,000 candles in chandeliers. The magnificent Ottoman Army performed isha prayer by candlelight, the name refers to it,\u201d wrote Bardakci at the time of his historic visit to Al Aqsa.\n\nWhen he saw a very old man in the mosque courtyard, the journalist went over and exchanged Islamic greetings with him. He asked who he was and was astonished by the reply.\n\n\u201cI am Corporal Hasan from the 20th Corp, 36th Battalion, 8th Squadron heavy machine gun team,\u201d said the then 90-year-old soldier. Speaking like a true serviceman giving a debrief about his mission, the old man with a long, white beard continued: \u201cOur troops raided the British on the Suez Canal front in the Great War. Our glorious army was defeated at the Canal. To withdraw was requisite now. The heirloom lands of our ancestors were about to be lost one by one. And then, the Brits pressed upon the gates of Al-Quds [Jerusalem], and occupied the city. We were left as rearguard troops at Al-Quds.\u201d\n\nThere were 53 soldiers in the rearguard who were told that they would be discharged from duty once the Mondros Armistice was signed. \u201cOur lieutenant was leading us. He said, \u2018My lions, our country is in an arduous situation. They are discharging our glorious army and calling me to Istanbul. I have to go, if I don\u2019t I\u2019d be in defiance of authority, failing to obey the order. Anyone can return to the homeland if he wills, but if you follow my words, I have a request from you: Quds is an heirloom of Sultan Selim Han. Remain on guard duty here. Don\u2019t let the people worry that the Ottomans have left; what we are going to do now. The Westerners will exult if Ottomans left the first qibla of our beloved Prophet. Don\u2019t let the honour of Islam and the glory of Ottomans be trampled on.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo, Hasan and his comrades duly stayed in Al-Quds. \u201cAnd, almost suddenly, the long years vanished. My brothers from the troop passed away one by one. We weren\u2019t mowed down by the enemy, but by the years. Only I am left here. Just me, Corporal Hasan in grand Al-Quds.\u201d\n\nReading this sent a shiver down my spine. The stories of these heroes of our Ummah are sadly not often written down. They pass into legend by word of mouth.\n\nAnd what a legend. When you compare these totally selfless, God-fearing soldiers to the rabble deployed by the so-called Israel Defence Forces and Border Police, you just know that there\u2019s a huge difference in terms of their sense of duty. These honourable men would never have gone charging into a mosque or any other place of worship and beaten unarmed worshippers with batons, as uniformed Israeli thugs did in a display so savage that the international community felt compelled to protest.\n\nWhen Bardakci returned home he tried to track down Corporal Hasan\u2019s commander, Lieutenant Mustafa Efendi, to let him know that his soldiers followed his orders and one was still on duty at Al-Aqsa Mosque. However, the once young Ottoman officer had passed away years earlier.\n\nTen years after meeting Corporal Hasan, Bardakci received a telegram in 1982 that read simply: \u201cThe last Ottoman guardian at Al-Aqsa Mosque passed away today.\u201d\n\nCorporal Hasan had finally left his post, but he must never be forgotten. He is a symbol of the courage and sense of duty that we should all hold for Al-Aqsa Mosque; a duty that is needed today more than ever before, because Al-Aqsa has become a trigger for violence by the latest occupiers of Palestine which has sparked even more violence across the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Jerusalem.\n\nI fear that the tension will not dissipate any time soon, not least because 2,000 Jewish leaders and representatives from around the world are heading for the region to hold an Extraordinary Zionist Congress marking the 75th anniversary of what Palestinians call the Nakba \u2014 the creation of the State of Israel and ethnic cleansing of the people of Palestine \u2014 as well as the 125th anniversary of the first Zionist Congress held in Basel.\n\nAfter the end of the First World War, Corporal Hasan thought that he just had to defend the Noble Sanctuary of Al Aqsa from the invading British Army. He could never have imagined that the day would come when undisciplined Israeli thugs would bring such disrespect, death and destruction to this tiny patch of ground, the value of which Corporal Hasan Al-Aghdarli placed above his own freedom. Turkiye should be proud of the Ottoman soldier and his colleagues; Palestine should hold them in high esteem; and the rest of the Muslim world should emulate them in our devotion to Al-Aqsa Mosque.\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.\n",

I would like to ask if any of you have knowledge of such hadiths.\n\nMy second question concerns the conflict between Israel and Palestine. As Shia Muslims, do we believe that Al-Aqsa Mosque will be destroyed and that a Third Temple will be built in its place? Do we hold the belief that Greater Israel will come into existence? Is the war between Israel and Palestine truly one of the major signs of the Day of Judgment? I recall seeing a video where a scholar mentioned that people asked Imam Baqir and Imam Sadiq about who would destroy the Jews and Israel, and they replied that this task would be carried out by the Iranians. Is this accurate?\n\n\u062c\u0632\u0627\u06a9 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u06c1",

            "body": "Just to preface: I'm an Israeli, I fully believe that a two state solution is the only way for peace and that eventually Israel will have to withdraw from the west bank.\n\nLast month the UN general assembly passed a resolution calling for the complete withdrawal of Israel from the occupied territories in 12 months, among other things. This is obviously completely impossible for 2 main reasons -\n\n1. Currently there are around 700K Israelis living in the west bank and transfering all of them out of there in a year is simply not doable. It's not like Israel has cities, houses and jobs ready to accommodate these people. The toll such a massive transfer of civilians would take on the economy and probably military is just too high for such a move to be realistic.\n\n2. Israel cannot withdraw from the west bank before it is stable enough to not be threat to Israeli security. Pulling the army out of the west bank would leave Israel's heartland completely exposed to attacks from militants within the territory, something Israel simply can't allow to happen as it would majorly compromise the country's security. This is obviously the main reason why such a hasty, one sided withdrawal is impossible. \n\nThis makes this resolution, in my opinion, detrimental to peace and not the opposite. \n\nThis is because it's a resolution that Israel simply cannot accept. The consequences of this will be that many around the world and in Palestine will have the idea that Israel continuously ignores UN resolutions reinforced and Israel will garner even more hate for it. And in Israel it feeds straight into the \"UN and everyone is anti - semitic and can't be trusted\" narrative, which only strengths and emboldens the nationalists and drives people away from peace. \nI also thinks this leads the the UN becoming less credible as what's it's point if it is pushing out unrealistic resolutions? \n\nIn my opinion if the UN truely cared about achieving peace they would adopt a resolution calling for Israel and the PA to restart earnest talks about adopting a 2 state solution, and the fact they instead adopted this one shows their interest isn't peace, but rather virtue signaling and optics. \n\nNow I know some might say that the UN general assembly resolutions are non binding and it's more about sending a message and reinforcing international law, but I would still say that sending an unrealistic message is useless and causes more harm than good.

Despite the passing of the UN Resolution 181, it was rejected by Palestinian Arabs and Arab nations. \n\nArab nations (Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Jordan (Transjordan), Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, etc\u2026) started the 1948 Arab-Israel war by invading territory in the former British Mandate for Palestine immediately following the announcement of the independence of the state of Israel on May 14, 1948. \n\nMy questions\n\n1. If the Palestinians and pro-Palestine supporters wanted a two state solution, why did they reject UN resolution 181 and started the 1948 Arab-Israel war ? If only Palestinians and pro-Palestine supporters had accepted UN resolution 181, there would have been no war and a sovereign nation called Palestine would has been long established back in 1948, 76 years ago.\n\n2. At its very core the UN resolution 181 : United Nations Partition Plan for British Mandate for Palestine is very similar to any two state solution, the map or borders may differ with each version, but at the end of the day, UN resolution 181 and two state solution aims to create two sovereign states, one Jewish (Israel) and one Arab (Palestine). Is the UN resolution 181 similar to other proposed two state solution throughout the years ?\n\n3. If the UN resolution 181 is similar (not exactly identical, but similar) to a two state solution which has already been rejected by the Palestinians and pro-Palestine supporters 76 years ago which started a war, and now some Palestinians, some pro-Palestinians, many governments and non-government organizations are yet again calling for a similar two state solution. What has changed since 76 years ago ? Why do Palestinians and pro-Palestine supporters now want a two state solution which they had rejected 76 years ago ? ",

I know everything is more expensive when it has the term wedding attatched to it what i wasn't expecting was an $950 dress plus $120 veil! \n\nI'm using my dad's old tux he used for his wedding to my mom,just had it taken in a little, Emma can't use her mum's dress as her and her mum both say the style hasn't aged well wich is fair. \n\nI had a quick google around at dresses online and there were so many! and so many just like the one emma wants for like $50 to $100. \n\nI'm not trying to get her to cheap out on her dress but she will literally wear it once, one dress for over $1000 is just insane that would fund our honeymoon . \n\nI tried to show her some dresses i found on a reccomended app called wish and others on website's but she was having none of it. \n\nShe is very slender but apparantly wants it specially fitted? \n\nIt turned nasty unfortunately because i said i refuse to drop such a large amount of money on a dress and she argued that she is using her own money for the dress. \n\nWich isn't strictly true as we ate about to marry and our finances will be joined. \n\nThen her mom had to get involved, they offered to pay for the dress but it's not a case of not being able to afford it. \n\nIt's a dress! there are identical one's online at a fraction of the cost. \n\nI thought she would be ecstatic to learn there are identical dresses for a fraction of the cost but she was really angry and upset. \n\n\nAITA here? is there something i am seriously missing because after we argued about the dress emma has been Extremely cold towards me. \n\nThen yestersay she said if i want her to cheap out on her wedding dress on her wedding day that she needs to really consider if we are a good match for marriage. \n\nIm blown away that she would say that over a dress, i told her she's like a toddler throwing a tantrum over a sparkly toy she can't have, that was a mistake as she left to stay with her parent's,  who called to tell me i am much more than an asshole. \n\nAITA here? \n\nTL;DR fiancee can get similar dress for around $100 with shipping online but wants to blow over $1000 at a local wedding dress boutique aita for saying to get a cheaper one online? \n\nEDIT: Emma found this thread, it was a mistake to post here and im sorry i posted our problems on reddit,  iata \n\n**VERDICT: ASSHOLE** \n\n**The Top Replies from OOP** \n\n[Comment 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/CIW68ccfUn) \n\n>but the gowns i found on wish looked very professionally made? and very similar to the one she's picked \n\n[Comment 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/arwrDS87AV) \n\n>I mentioned the second-hand wedding dress store and she said no without even going to take a look. \n\n[Comment 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/cIQDeNV5HD) \n\n>That's not fair, i would never tell her what to wear, she can wear what she wants,  it is the absurd price that i am againt. \n\n[Comment 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/CigD3Tnmwz) \n\n>See i can definately understand caring about the quality of a dress if its a work dress or a regularly worn formal dress, i think what everyone's missing is that this will be worn for 1 day only. \n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS** \n\n**u/MaryMaryConsigliere** \n\n> Emma: Ask yourself if your fiance's behavior here is a one-off. There are some concerning things here: \n\n> * His insistence on controlling your purchase, made with your money, *even if it's funded by your parents*. Is he controlling in other ways? Has he ever been insistent on you spending your time and money only in ways he approves of, and does he usually lash out when you don't do what he wants? \n\n> * The way he's resorting to name calling because you wouldn't capitulate to his demands (calling you a toddler throwing a tantrum) instead of communicating with you respectfully. This is made especially worse by the fact that his demands are unreasonable and stem from a fundamental ignorance about the subject (wedding gown cost, what knockoffs are and why they're a bad idea, etc.), and that he's shutting down your attempts to educate him. Does he normally communicate with you openly and respectfully? Does he normally get angry and verbally attack you when you disagree with him? Are you normally able to have conversations with him on difficult topics that are calm, respectful and productive, even when you disagree? \n\n>Maybe you're both cracking under wedding planning strain, and this is an out-of-character moment that you can work through, but maybe this is pointing to a larger pattern. Proceed with caution. Remember you're about to enter into a pretty intense legal and social contract with this man, and that you're signing up for a lifetime of conflict resolution with this person in particular. The way you both approach disagreement and handle conflict now reflects how you'll be likely to continue to do so going forward. Now may be the time to double check with yourself if this is the right move. \n\n>Edit: After reading through the comments, I would also encourage you to look at his behavior here, on this Reddit post. His response to new information is not to take it on board and process it, but to double down, plug his fingers in his ears, close his eyes, and refuse to listen. The lengths he'll go to to avoid admitting he was mistaken are a bit troubling. It may also be worth asking yourself if there's a reason someone who is so insistent on always being right may have for seeking out a partner who's a decade younger. I'm wishing you all the best, and I hope this works out for you.\n\n\n**OOP** \n\n>>I thought ide have a look through the comments to see if anything explained why emma has blocked me and her phone is ringing through to voicemail. I seriously can't believe people started a witch hunt over a dress, i watched some YouTube videos of wish wedding dresses, and yes wish are trash i get it, i was wrong aboit that site. But to end up blocked because you have all told her i am abusive and manipulative is just vile. I called her parents house and the line's off the hook,  so if you see this emma call me,  please, i won't shout,  i won't get mad i just want to end this crap. Get whatever dress you want i see that i was wrong I'm sorry. \n\n>>Spellings bad had some whiskey, can you blame me after this? \n\n**MaryMaryConsigliere** \n\n>>>Edit 2: Based on Josh's newest comment about you blocking him on messenger, it sounds like you're taking some time and space to think things over. I think that's a really good move. There's [a quiz from the Love is Respect project](https://www.loveisrespect.org/for-someone-else/is-my-relationship-healthy-quiz/) that may help clarify your thinking about whether this is a healthy, nurturing relationship. I hope everything turns out well for you, Emma, whatever you decide to do! There's a whole community of people here rooting for you to be happy. \n\n>>>Edit 3: It looks like OP has been banned from AITA. He just sent me a [furious, invective-filled PM](https://imgur.com/iLeiyT0) blaming the sub for what's happening in his personal relationship and reiterating that abusive behavior is normal and fine, so I guess he's learned nothing. According to the PM, Emma's dad just called him and chewed him out, so it sounds like at least she has a strong familial support system. \n\n**TRANSCRIPT OF THE PM** \n\n**banned** \n\n>>>im now banned from aita and good fucking riddance, her dad just called to cuss me the fuck out, can you believe ive ben trying to not FUCKING cuss so i don't get banned so i can atleast defend myself then banned for no reason. i live in the real world where when people are angry they yell, they save money where they can and they don't fucking run away and block you. fuck this fuck . it. all and fuck emma for believing strangers on the internet over her fiancee of 2 fucking years\n\n\n**~** \n\n**cupcakes_and_vodka** \n\n>EMMA - IF YOU SEE THIS, RUN FOR THE FUCKING HILLS. Men who are almost 40 marry 27 year olds often because they are manipulative and going to pull shit a woman his age won't put up with. He is too old for you. You are seeing signs of this behavior NOW. 950 bucks for a wedding dress ain't shit... He is already trying to control and manipulate you and your finances and you aren't EVEN MARRIED YET. DON'T GO THROUGH WITH IT. \n\n>OP, you are a massive asshole and she shouldn't marry you. \n\n**OOP** \n\n>>wow,  thanks, seriously,  she has been keeping up with this thread because she told me not to take it down, she wanted to read the replies,  and now she's blocked me on messenger and my calls go to voicemail so thanks a lot everyone couldn't have left it at yta legitimately out for blood, mob mentality if ever i saw it. \n\n**The Bride** \n\n[Me [23f] with my fiancee[43 M ] of 1 and a half years, he has humiliated me just a few months before our wedding over my dress and I dont know what to do.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ep4h1n/me_23f_with_my_fiancee43_m_of_1_and_a_half_years/?share_id=B3PmcR2QJtJqHjiYZU-Mf&utm_content=1&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1)  **Jan 15, 2020**\n\n\ni will change the name despite his inability to do the same i don't really care if he sees this but he isn't subbed to relationships \n\ni literally don't know where to start, my fiancee we'll call  Greg.  I dont know what came over him, its completely insane, we are getting married summer, the argument started over my wedding dress. \n\ni picked a very simple and traditional gown that was already discounted as it is an ex sample gown.  my absolute idiot of a fiancee decided to post to a subreddit asking for opinions or more likely validation on whether was being unreasonable.  \n\nmy dress is under 1000 dollars but will come to around 1500 with alterations.  \n\nwe have over 7 thousand left over in our budget, that's another thing that seriously upset me that he lied in his post multiple times, i make a much higher salary than him so we agreed he woukd put 5 k towards the wedding and i put in the rest but why lie?  why ask opinions if you've skewed the details \n\ni had absolutely no problem with this as he makes Just above the minimum wage.  \n\nthe thread got way too much attention, i had already gone to my parents because i was angry about him calling me immature and shouting about me being spollt.  \n\ni also happened to find the thread shortly after he made it because not only did he use my real name his throwaway was his real name followed by his alarm pin!  \n\nhe sent me a text saying that he wasn't the asshole in this situation and i just KNEW he would post it on reddit, it's not the first time he's posted on reddit about stuff.  \n\nbut nothing of this magnitude, anyway i don't know what to do, there are people online now claiming to be me and its been shared on twitter and Facebook and I'm just absolutely mortified.  \n\nhe got totally hammared last night and called my parents, my dad had to hang up on him because he was screaming down the phone and my mom was disgusted.  \n\ni cant get my money back on the venue or anything, i recently started antidepressants because I've been feeling low but now i Just feel empty.  \n\nthis whole thing was about the cost of my dress and he suggested I use the wish app to get an identical gown, first he refused to listen to me that wish is garbage but he also argued it to the death in the comments!  \n\ni read every single comment in that thread and it was like being punched in the gut, i can't get over the odd lies either, he gave out my real name and his but lied about the age gap and budget. \n\ni am 23 he is 43 admittedly he looks much much younger and for the first few weeks dating i thought he was in his early thirties.  we also have only been together a year not 2 years i think he said, and im starting to think this was all too fast.  \n\ni need help, i need advice, i know im quite possibly pot calling the kettle by posting to reddit but i post here alot usually anyway and all the fake accounts claiming be me might throw him off anyway.  \n\ni might be slow replying as i start work in an hour thanks all x \n\ntl;dr fiancee posted to reddit to get opinions on the price of my wedding dress but used my real name and it all blew up, bow people are creating fake accounts pretending to  be me and he has devolved to calling me names and getting drunk and calling my family, he also lied about a lot of details in the post, how do I handle this calmly? \n\n**3 months later to ex-fianc\u00e9 made a post** \n\n[Struggling to get back in to the dating scene since my fiancee left me unexpectedly](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/gcq6zv/struggling_to_get_back_in_to_the_dating_scene/)  **May 3, 2020** \n\nA few months back I was going to be married, and long story short things were called off. \n\nShe wanted to end things, I didn't. And I feel like I've lost all of my trust in woman I dont want to feel like this anymore. \n\nI  was dating someone called isabelle up until last week shes really  amazing and kind but the second she heard about my ex and the fiasco  that surrounded it she ghosted me. \n\nAnd  its become a pattern, at some point no matter how close were getting  they hear about it from a friend it comes up somehow and they bail. \n\nI  just want to know how to behave, or what I can do to make things work?  My last gf kacey, when she broke up with me she said the issue what that  I hadn't chanced from who I was when my fiancee left me but I have! \n\nI  hardly drink at all now, my job is steady and I'm a good guy, but I  think the issue is that I'm suffering from small town syndrome. \n\nEveryone knows everyone here back asswards little town it is. \n\nPlease please give me advice on putting this behind me I am honestly desperate. \n\nMy  life was about to move towards a phase and now I'm stuck in limbo, I  need a girl to fill that place so I can move forward with my life.\n\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**",

A two-state solution is a myth; sufficient clarity will never be reached.\n2. \"Negotiated two-state solution\" is code for giving Israel a veto over the process.\n3. Given the geography and Israel\u2019s security demands, the idea of a truly independent and viable Palestinian state is fundamentally incompatible.\n4. As long as the regime in Israel is Zionist it will never relinquish Jewish claim to Judea and Samaria, the biblical land promised to the Israelites in the Torah. Culturally, ideologically, and philosophically, it\u2019s impossible\u2014Zionism is fundamentally about Jews returning to their historic homeland, not just that little strip along the coast.\u00a0\n\nThe two-state solution isn't about finding a way to share the land; it's about buying time for Israel to further Judaize it. It's a tool for politicians to avoid openly choosing between supporting a Jewish ethno-supremacist state with nuclear weapons or a democratic state with a slight Arab majority that could coexist peacefully with Iran.\n\n[https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-uks-explanation-of-vote-on-the-un-general-assembly-resolution-on-the-icjs-advisory-opinion-on-israels-presence-in-the-occupied-palestinian-terr](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-uks-explanation-of-vote-on-the-un-general-assembly-resolution-on-the-icjs-advisory-opinion-on-israels-presence-in-the-occupied-palestinian-terr)",

Dragon\u2019s Heart Tower, Level 23, Residence 30. Thalmin and Ilunor\u2019s Dorm. Local Time: 1900 Hours.**\n\n**Emma**\n\n*\u201cExcuse me?\u201d* Ilunor\u2019s words echoed throughout the room, his disbelief resonating with a sharp trill.\n\nThe Vunerian met my gaze with a wide-eyed disbelief, prompting me to cut to the chase, and to sharpen the needle poised to burst his Nexian-grade ego-bubble.\n\n\u201cIt would seem as if we both went through a similar paradigm-shift event, Ilunor. A point in which this shiny yellow metal just finally stopped holding its own value. A fundamental point of divergence in which it lost its ability to hold its own\u2026 *weight in gold*.\u201d I reiterated, announcing those words loud and clear for the Vunerian, hoping that the EVI was able to translate that bad attempt at humor to something at least discernable in High-Nexian. \u201cGold as it currently stands, has lost its historical value. It\u2019s no longer the rare be-all and end-all metal. It has, using your own words, *lost its luster*.\u201d\n\nThalmin had finally returned with Thacea just as I\u2019d finished making that bold statement, the prince seemingly adamant on making this entire exchange one which all parties were privy to.\n\nIlunor didn\u2019t pay them mind however, as his gaze was locked onto me, his features contorting into one of genuine disbelief, before finding itself back in a signature look of incredulous scrutiny.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re bluffing.\u201d He retorted. \u201cThere is no means for an adjacent realm, for *any* realm other than the Nexus, to have both discovered and matured the art of pinnacle-transmutation.\u201d\n\nI raised a brow at this, cocking my head to overcome my emoting handicap. \u201cPinnacle-transmutation?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe alchemical art of transmuting one form of inexpensive and readily-available matter, into an otherwise rare form of matter, using mana and other mana-based materials as a *catalyst*.\u201d The blue thing helpfully clarified.\n\nThis prompted me to feign a moment of thought, bringing my fingers up to my chin.\n\n\u201cYou know what Ilunor, you\u2019re right!\u201d I nodded, eliciting a smarmy grin from the deluxe kobold. \u201cWe *don\u2019t* have magical transmutation, at least not in the way that you think, let alone your whole lead-into-gold style magical alchemy.\u201d I quickly expanded, garnering more self-satisfied looks from the Vunerian; as he reached that point of peak smugness. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t really need it.\u201d I clarified, pulling the rug right from underneath the Vunerian. \u201cMoreover, it didn\u2019t stop us from achieving the same state of precious metal devaluation that you went through.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh dear Majesty, not this again\u2026\u201d He responded emphatically, before diving back into the thick of the conversation. \u201cThere exists only two means of acquiring gold.\u201d The Vunerian snarled out. \u201cOne \u2014 through brute force, by mining into the earth itself and laboriously collecting this *beautiful, shiny, irresistible* metal.\u201d He almost went into a sort of trance for a moment there, but managed to pull back before continuing unabated. \u201cTwo \u2014 by transmutation. The latter is what has caused gold to become so readily abundant, so\u2026 unexpectedly worthless. And since you admit to lacking the latter\u2026 are you expecting me to believe that you have achieved our current state of abundance through the former?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d I replied immediately, and a matter of factly. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m *hoping you\u2019ll* believe, because that\u2019s *exactly what happened*. Through good old fashioned sheer brute force\u2026 or more specifically, by expanding our operations to scales and extents never before seen \u2014 we turned gold from an object of indescribable value, to a chunk of pretty yellow metal.\u201d I took a moment to let that sink in, as my mind went to ponder a second, more *technical* talking point.\n\n*\u2018I mean, we* ***technically*** *have \u2018transmutation\u2019, or at least, a sci-tech equivalent of it\u2026 but it\u2019s just woefully impractical and more of a gimmick compared to the efficiency harvesting space-rocks and dwarf planetoids.\u2019*\n\nI decided it was probably best to *skip* that talking point for now, at least, until a foundation could be built to discuss *that* can of worms.\n\nA few seconds of silence punctuated my first point, as it was clear Ilunor was taking the time to actively *consider* it.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re going to claim to have *brute-forced* the accumulation of metals, both precious and utilitarian, from the surface of your world; to the point of complete exhaustion?\u201d The Vunerian shot back in an almost rhetorical way through a desperate chuckle. Though that series of dismissive laughs was barely able to hide the fear which underpinned it. A fear which was blatantly obvious from the furrowing of his brow ridges, and the narrowing of his slitted pupils.\n\nA fear that this line of questioning would lead to an answer he simply didn\u2019t want to hear.\n\nA fear which was reflected even in the eyes of both Thacea and Thalmin.\n\nA fear\u2026 that would come to pass with a single-worded answer.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d I answered simply.\n\nColor once more drained from the Vunerian\u2019s face, as he seemed to almost lose his footing atop of his nest of gold.\n\nIt was at that point that he broke his gaze, his expressions shifting from tentative disbelief, to frustration, before landing back on what I was beginning to call his resting Nexus-face \u2014 a look of superiority that resulted from either active denial, or a root error in fundamental systemic incongruency.\n\n\u201cAlright then.\u201d He retorted, sarcasm oozing through each and every syllable. \u201cLet\u2019s *suppose* this is all well and true. Where is your gold? Where is your silver? If you truly have *broken the shackles of earthly scarcity*, then surely you must have *more*!\u201d He continued, as he maneuvered himself through the gold pile, and back onto solid ground. Eventually, he managed to find the gold he\u2019d plinked in my general direction, holding it high above his head. \u201cI am willing to *entertain* your ridiculous claims. So in lieu of any long-winded displays, show me just how much your people have given you as instruments of trade and barter for this journey. Because *this*\u2014\u201d He paused, waving the gold coin around. \u201c\u2014is a *pittance* for any self-respecting *newrealmer* hoping to forge relations.\u201d\n\nI took a moment to quickly grab the cylindrical *precious-materials dispenser* (PMD), holding the hefty oversized candy dispenser in my hands for a moment, before lobbing it over towards the Vunerian.\n\nThe deluxe kobold managed to snatch it like a pro, as he examined the rather simple device, eyeing it from every possible angle.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take him long to figure out how it worked, as those greedy little grabby-hands found their way towards the bottom \u2018slot\u2019, pinching it sideways, resulting in a satisfying \u2014 *CHA-CHING!* \u2014 reminiscent of ultra-vintage cash registers; something the engineers back at the IAS claimed *wasn\u2019t* intentional.\n\nThough I had my own reservations on that.\n\nA single silver coin, exactly one troy ounce in weight, was gently ejected from the unassuming cylindrical device.\n\nOn it, was the Greater United Nations\u2019 seal sans its signature fourteen stars, flanked by raised lettering which read \u2018*Greater United Nations - Peace and Prosperity for All*\u2019. Flipping the coin to the other side, the Vunerian would find the missing fourteen stars, which was then flanked by a series of smaller raised lettering which read \u2018*Minted Under Special Order 32-7. FOR EXCLUSIVE USE IN DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS*\u2019.\n\nThe Vunerian took a few careful moments to regard the coin, flipping it through his fingers, before simply letting it fall to the floor with a satisfying *clink*!\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s disrespectful, Ilunor.\u201d Thalmin uttered with a dulcet growl, which Ilunor simply ignored as he pressed onwards.\n\n*CHA-CHING*!\n\nCame another silver coin.\n\n*CHA-CHING*!\n\nThen another.\n\n*CHA-CHING*!\n\nThen *another*.\n\n*CHA-CHING*!\n\nAnd *another*.\n\n*CHA-CHING*!\n\nThe Vunerian kept clicking that little mechanical button, mashing it to the point where the noises all just blended together, until he finally made it through the copper and silver, finally arriving into the gold section of the tube.\n\nHe once more went through the same motions, twirling the innocuous shiny object in his fingers, before simply dropping it.\n\n\u201cDead\u2026 and *uninspired*.\u201d He added, probably referring to the same relief patterns on either side of the coin.\n\nAnd so, the pattern continued, as he kept *mashing* that button, until the final gold coin *clinked* satisfyingly onto the small pile made by his little outburst.\n\nBut gold and silver wasn\u2019t all that was in there.\n\nAs he curiously pressed the button once more\u2014\n\n*CHA-CHING*!\n\n\u2014to reveal what appeared to be just another silver coin, albeit slightly *smaller*, landing on the palm of his hand.\n\nThe formerly unimpressed Vunerian\u2019s expressions visibly changed at that coin, as his face quickly contorted from one of passive indifference, to abrupt attentiveness.\n\nFor starters, he began raising his hand up and down, as if \u2018weighing\u2019 the thing by feeling alone.\n\nNext, he picked up one of the silver coins that\u2019d accumulated by his feet, as he held both side by side, noting just how marginally *larger* the silver was compared to this similarly gray and shiny coin.\n\nHis eyes widened after that, as he dropped the silver coin, and immediately reached for his monocle.\n\nSeconds passed, as he spent nearly a minute inspecting every nook and cranny of the identically-minted coin.\n\nIt was only after a minute that he finally dropped his monocle.\n\nHowever, instead of simply *dropping* the coin to the floor as he\u2019d done to the rest of them, he raised it up towards his maw, poised to *bite it* instead.\n\nThe deluxe kobold started by attempting to sink one of his many sharp teeth into the coin, before devolving into outright *nibbling* on it, as if attempting to gnaw out some shavings from it.\n\nIt was after a few seconds of these motions, that he did something I hadn\u2019t ever anticipated from him.\n\nHe went full gremlin mode.\n\nIn a single swift motion, the deluxe kobold simply *shoved* the coin straight into his maw.\n\n\u201cIlunor, what are you\u2014\u201d\n\n**ALERT: LOCALIZED SURGE OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED, 300% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**\n\n**ALERT: EXTERNAL TEMPERATURES EXCEEDING SAFE LEVELS. 400\u2026 725\u2026 997\u2026 1227 DEGREES CELSIUS.**\n\nWithout warning, flames erupted from his maw, the likes of which prompted Thacea to intervene by covering *our* side of the room in a small blanket of snow, courtesy of her snow-princess powers and the series of little snow-clouds that\u2019d formed just over top of each of us.\n\nThis went on for a solid half a minute, before he finally relented, huffing and puffing all the while, as he eventually spat out the coin; the still-intact disc sizzled and clinked as it eventually came to a rest on the stone floor.\n\nSilence dominated the room after that whole stunt.\n\nThalmin however, would be the first to break that silence, reiterating a former point I\u2019d made.\n\n\u201cIlunor, what in ancestors\u2019 and spirits\u2019 names are you doing?!\u201d He shouted out.\n\nSurprisingly, however, Ilunor didn\u2019t respond.\n\nNot with a dismissive remark, nor with a coy retort.\n\nInstead, he simply remained silent, his eyes as wide as dinner plates as he weakly and warily knelt down to pick up the coin; a surge of mana radiation indicating that he\u2019d cooled it down quickly prior to touching it.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t silver.\u201d He noted bluntly, turning towards Thalmin first.\n\n\u201cSo what if it isn\u2019t silver? What the hell did you do all of that for\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is *platinum*.\u201d He began, his voice shaky and in tentative disbelief. \u201c*Pure* platinum, with no impurities\u2026 sans the alloys necessary to strengthen the soft metal.\u201d\n\nIt was at that point that Thacea and Thalmin, in that order, started to register *something* about Ilunor\u2019s revelation.\n\nThough it hadn\u2019t clicked with me just yet.\n\n\u201cYeah, so, can you not transmute platinum or something? You were so big and mighty just a second ago when you were going on about the whole \u2014 *breaking the shackles of earthly scarcity* \u2014 thing. So what\u2019s with this reaction?\u201d I shot back.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 not so much about the platinum itself, Emma.\u201d Thacea spoke up, taking over from the still-dazed Ilunor. \u201cPlatinum, along with most rare metals in existence, are all capable of being alchemically transmuted, and thus are worthless until attuned. However what *surprises* us, and Ilunor in particular, is the fact that you even *have* platinum at all. This is because historically speaking, it is rare to find a newrealm that utilizes platinum as a form of currency or a store of wealth, *prior* to the adoption of pinnacle-transmutation. Some might not even recognize it as a distinct form of metal, whilst most might simply find the *traditional* process of refinement too much of a hassle, thereby disregarding it outright due to the difficulties involved.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, those that *do*, process it in *limited quantities*; relegating it to decoration and jewelry, or a relatively rare store of wealth. This leaves gold, copper, silver, electrum, and copper as the typical forms of currency in most adjacent realms *prior* to Nexian reformations.\u201d Thalmin promptly added, giving Thacea a nod as they tag-teamed this impromptu explanation.\n\n\u201cAll of this is to say, Emma, that your possession of minted platinum, runs counter to typical conventions.\u201d Thacea promptly surmised.\n\n\u201cAnd it serves only to reinforce your claims of having somehow achieved a state of *post-shackling*, without Nexian intervention.\u201d The lupinor prince added with a bewildered, yet excitable expression.\n\nA small grin suddenly formed across my face, as I knelt down to pick up the fallen coins, and in the process snatched the PMD from the Vunerian.\n\n\u201cThis is not to say it isn\u2019t unheard of.\u201d Ilunor attempted to reason. \u201cThis is\u2026 this is just unprecedented, clearly just\u2026 a one-off statement of wealth.\u201d He stammered out, before finally collecting himself. \u201cSo? Is that *all* you have, earthrealmer? I admit, this\u2026 rather *audacious* display of wealth is certainly one thing, but for an adjacent realm, this merely places you as a cut above the rest. Nothing *truly* remarkable, nothing that could indicate you\u2019ve achieved *earthly post-shackling*, as Prince Thalmin so clearly wishes to advocate\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about I just skip the pleasantries and show you the *treasury*, Ilunor?\u201d I offered with a grin.\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\n=====\n\n**The Transgracian Academy for the Magical Arts. Dragon\u2019s Heart Tower, Level 23, Residence 30. Thalmin and Ilunor\u2019s Dorm. Local Time: 1900 Hours.**\n\n**Ilunor**\n\nThe earthrealmer was bluffing.\n\nI was sure of it.\n\nThe platinum coins were a ruse, a clever attempt at making me *assume* the *unassumable*.\n\nThe potential that they could truly be\u2026 **no**.\n\nThat was impossible.\n\nFor in spite of their\u2026 *manaless* miracles, there was one miracle that simply could not be replicated without the aid of magic, or in this case, alchemy \u2014 the unshackling of earthly binds.\n\nIt was a known fact that every adjacent realm that has ever come into contact with the Nexus, lacked Nexus-grade alchemy, or alchemical magics altogether.\n\nThey *might* have had *some* form of transmutation, yes. They might even have some form of intermediate alchemy. But none could match the purity of Nexian transmutations, let alone perfecting the art of *pinnacle* transmutations.\n\nIt was because of this that the Nexus stood alone as the only realm to have broken those earthly binds.\n\nIndeed, this meant that only the Nexus had crossed that threshold, where unattuned gold, *dead gold*, could be considered as worthless as iron or dirt.\n\nAnd indeed, this meant none could resist the final nail in the coffin that came with all Nexian Reformations \u2014 the influx of worthless wealth, and the complete devaluation of what gold, silver, copper, or whatever may be present in their coffers.\n\nFor even the wealthiest of adjacent realms buckled and crumbled upon *this* aspect of the Nexian reformation.\n\nAs even the mightiest of \u2018Emperors\u2019 and \u2018Kings\u2019 could not operate, if the lifeblood of economic exchange was rendered null and void.\n\nThe shock alone managed to kill empires.\n\nThe long term effects of which, meant that only by adopting *Attuned* coins, were they able to operate as they once did.\n\nThough this tactic was most often employed *if* the knee had yet to be bent.\n\nMost rulers however, understood the threat of this bloodless war.\n\nAnd as such, most acquiesced long before it could even be a possibility\u2026 and were rewarded handsomely for it.\n\nPerhaps this is why the earthrealmer wished to hold her ground, as she intended on bluffing her way out of this trap.\n\nPerhaps she understood, after my earlier statements, that only by bluffing would she be able to stand toe to toe with the monolith that was the Nexus\u2019 treasury.\n\nPerhaps this was why she was so adamant to stand toe to toe with a dragon, when she could scarcely be considered a kobold.\n\n=====\n\n**The Transgracian Academy for the Magical Arts. Dragon\u2019s Heart Tower, Level 23, Residence 30. Emma and Thacea\u2019s Dorm. Local Time: 1920 Hours.**\n\n**Emma**\n\nWe\u2019d shuffled wordlessly towards my dorm, arriving at one of the few crates I\u2019d left untouched, unpacked, and outside of the tent.\n\n\u201cI understand your hesitation to believe my claims, Ilunor.\u201d I began. \u201cHowever, circling back to what you said before\u2026 you wanted to see just *how much* my people have provided me as instruments for trade and barter, yes?\u201d\n\nThe Vunerian refused to respond, simply standing there with both of his arms crossed, monocle at the ready.\n\nI took this as an opportunity to move towards the back of the crate, my hand poised for a dramatic flourish.\n\n\u201cPerhaps *this* is more what you had in mind?\u201d\n\nWith a satisfying *click*, I flicked open the crate\u2019s latches, pneumatic hisses signaling the equalization of pressure as all sides of the cube fell apart to reveal what to the average contemporary observer would seem akin to a solid mass of industrial-grade metals\u2026 but to most in human history, would be more akin to a representation of their most coveted desires \u2014 a disgustingly flagrant display of wealth, in the most innocuous of forms.\n\nA solid, hulking, cuboid mass of gold.\n\nBut that was only accounting for what was on the surface.\n\nA closer inspection would reveal a series of hairline seams seemingly overlaid atop of this glistening cube, betraying the fact that this seemingly unbreakable aurous monolith was in fact not a solid unibody object.\n\nInstead, it consisted of rows and columns, of stacks upon stacks of bricks which were roughly equivalent to the old \u2018good delivery\u2019 bar standard \u2014 modified following multiple UN resolutions on commodities standardization to meet new universal criteria. The most notable changes, being its size and dimensions, which deviated from the archetypical trapezoidal shape, to one that now more resembled a simple brick.\n\nThe Vunerian\u2019s height barely put him at eye-level with the top of the cube, so as he approached, the factory-polish *sheen* of the formerly precious metal managed to act almost like a mirror, betraying his expressions to Thacea and Thalmin who stood behind him.\n\nThe former\u2019s expression was one of tentative disbelief.\n\nWhilst the latter pair\u2019s, was a collective sense of sheer awe.\n\nNo one uttered a single word.\n\nSo I took that as my cue to move on.\n\nI slowly began rotating the cube on the provided multi-axial platform, revealing that the solid wall of gold was only *one* of the faces to what I dubbed *the wealth cube*.\n\nIndeed, as it slowly spun on its axis, it would soon reveal an entire face containing bricks with a distinct silverish sheen.\n\nIlunor approached even closer at this point, putting barely a foot of space between himself and the giant rotating cube of metal.\n\n\u201cIlunor, you might not want to come so close just in case something happens and it falls on\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c*Quiet*!\u201d He hissed, before managing to recompose himself. \u201cJust. Keep. Going.\u201d\n\nI acquiesced with a nod, continuing the unnecessarily dramatic spin as we eventually went past silver, and onto a face consisting of more than a single metal.\n\nThe Vunerian, and indeed both Thacea and Thalmin, raised a brow at this face of the wealth cube consisting of the less common *utilitarian* metals, from tungsten to copper, to iridium and titanium \u2014 practically every other metal that could be reliably stored in the iconic commodities-standards brick-form.\n\nYet it was the last of the faces of this *wealth cube* that I was more interested in showing, given the immediate ramifications.\n\n*The platinum face*.\n\nSo as we crested that multi-colored face, entering the realm of a literal wall of platinum, I took extra care to take note of each and every one of the gang\u2019s reactions.\n\nStarting with Ilunor, who at this point, was practically right up against the wall of platinum, his hands trembling as he attempted to \u2018inspect\u2019 it using his monocle; bursts of mana radiation punctuated each and every movement he made with it.\n\nHis formerly cocky features slowly betrayed him, as that facade of Nexian exceptionalism was slowly chipped away with each passing burst of mana radiation.\n\nThacea, however, had managed to regain her composure to the point of once more regaining her natural serenity.\n\nWhilst Thalmin went in the completely *opposite* direction\u2026\n\nThe wolf was now grinning ear-to-ear, holding short of a cackle as he observed not just Ilunor\u2019s reactions, but the *wealth cube* itself with glee.\n\nThis whole scene, and the vastly divergent reactions between Thalmin and Ilunor managed to pique my curiosity, overpowering my desire to continue the game of ones-upmanship with the Vunerian.\n\n\u201cIs this evidence enough for you, Ilunor?\u201d I asked, wishing to end the boasting game, as I stood there ready to set the record straight.\n\n\u201cThis should not be possible.\u201d He muttered out, reaching out a hand to touch the reflective wall.\n\n\u201cLike I said, we\u2019ve reached the same state of abundance.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard to accept, but it shouldn\u2019t *feel* like that much of a surprise for you, right? I mean, you can literally transmute as much platinum if you wanted to. Meanwhile, my realm manages to mine up and process as much platinum, gold, silver, copper, and whatever other metals there are for our machines to gobble up to the point of excess. So I guess we\u2019re *equals* in that sense?\u201d\n\nThe Vunerian attempted to form something of a coherent response to that, but ended up simply having his words clogging up his throat.\n\nIt was Thalmin who finally broke the silence however, as he walked over to Ilunor, and myself, before placing both of his hands on our shoulders.\n\n\u201cOne final question before I pull the words right out of Ilunor\u2019s mouth, Emma.\u201d He began.\n\n\u201cYes, Thalmin?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of this\u2014\u201d He gestured towards the *wealth cube*. \u201c\u2014is this truly as abundant as you claim it to be in your realm?\u201d\n\n\u201cYup.\u201d I nodded. \u201cNow, I know that there\u2019ll be questions about just how transactions are made and how the economy functions in such a state, but please understand that like, we already got rid of the gold standard and the peg of currency to gold like\u2026 at least a millennium ago. We also experimented with fiat currency for centuries after that, then, following that, we implemented a form of UBI after automation started buckling the traditional economic models, and we doubled down after we managed to crack mass-resource gathering from\u2014\u201d\n\n*\u2018Space-based industries.\u2019*\n\n\u201c\u2014the expansion of our resource gathering efforts.\u201d I paused, before backtracking a bit, as Thalmin\u2019s expressions started growing from supportive vigor to tentative confusion. \u201cIn any case, yes, Thalmin. The answer is yes.\u201d\n\nThe lupinor\u2019s grin returned following that, as he let out a slow series of chuckles, before evolving into an outright cackle as he slapped the wealth cube *hard*. Hard enough that I felt the pain of that impact.\n\n\u201cWell then Emma Booker of Earthrealm, I congratulate you on your immunity to one of the apocalyptic dragons of the Nexian Reformations.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d I responded reflexively, before suddenly\u2026 it clicked.\n\nMy eyes locked with Thacea, then Ilunor, then Thalmin, before going back to Thacea as the avinor gave me a resolute nod.\n\n\u201cI should\u2019ve known from the ffffricking beginning.\u201d I managed out with a heavy breath. \u201cIt\u2019s so obvious now in retrospect.\u201d\n\nBoth Thacea and Thalmin nodded affirmatively, prompting me to let out another breath.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s part of their induction game? Inundating your realms with worthless rare metals, devaluing your treasuries, and then forcing you to adopt their *attuned* minted currency or what have you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the abridged version of events, Emma.\u201d Thacea acknowledged. \u201cBut it is, in effect, the essence of one of the apocalyptic dragons of the Nexian Reformations, as Thalmin has so colorfully described. If what you say is true, Emma\u2026 then this places your realm, as perhaps the first in recorded history, to have achieved\u2026 *resource parity* with that of the Nexus.\u201d\n\n\u201cResource parity, *upon first contact* at that!\u201d Thalmin eagerly added.\n\nThat statement, *both* of their statements\u2026 managed to hit me *hard*. What had begun as a simple exercise in proving the Vunerian wrong, had quickly evolved into an exercise in determining the relative material and resource potential of our two polities.\n\nThe fact that the Nexus was *heavily* abundant in raw and processed resources was not only a surprise, but a hard-hitting wakeup call.\n\nThe realization that it\u2019d used its excess resources as a part of its domination strategy shouldn\u2019t have surprised me\u2026 but hearing it laid out like this was still shocking all the same.\n\n\u201cAnd hasn\u2019t anyone ever tried *attuning* their own coins?\u201d I promptly asked the group.\n\n\u201cAs in, forgery?\u201d Thalmin shot back.\n\n\u201cI guess it would be forgery in a sense wouldn't it? Since attunement is just fancy mana minting?\u201d\n\n\u201cMany have tried, Emma.\u201d Thacea answered. \u201cHowever, the process of Nexian attunement is one that has been fine-tuned over the course of millennia. There are multiple layers to the Crown\u2019s attunement process, many of which line up with their mechanisms of control. First, there is raw attunement, which is the process of imbuing the gold itself with mana, then there is the individual binding every coin to the Crown Treasury\u2019s *Scroll of Coin*, finally there is the work of Artisan-Mages, whose entire careers are based around the personalized creation of attuned coins, each of which are bound to their signature and hold a particular unique quality bound to the artisan. These mechanisms of control make it so that every attuned coin is registered and tracked, and is always at threat of being recalled following the death of the Artisan-Mage.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, hold up for a moment.\u201d I raised both hands to stop Thacea\u2019s informative rambles. \u201cThese are pretty advanced security features for *gold coins*.\u201d I offered, as the preconceptions of a fantasy-medieval trade system was shattered, instead replaced with what appeared to be a somewhat robust financial system.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve said, Emma. These are *mechanisms of control*.\u201d Thacea reiterated.\n\n\u201cRight, right.\u201d I nodded, stowing away any specific questions on the Nexian *attunement* system for now, instead opting to finally close this point of contention with the Vunerian.\n\n\u201cI guess that means we\u2019re even here then.\u201d I offered Ilunor.\n\nTo which the Vunerian finally perked up, but still refused to voice a single response.\n\nThis prompted me to inch forwards towards the Vunerian, before leaning against the cube of wealth.\n\n\u201cThis means that the Nexus might find it to be in their best interests to practice diplomacy with a bit more *tact*, because its usual tricks are no longer a viable strategy\u2026 nor was it *ever* an acceptable strategy\u2026 but I digress. What I\u2019m trying to say here, Ilunor, is that this is the first time where the Nexus is going to have to interact with someone who matches its potential. At least as it pertains to the resource department.\u201d\n\n*\u2018We\u2019re tied, at least, in the basic resource and economic war front. You can\u2019t just pour your dead gold in our faces, nor can we pump out attuned gold your way.\u2019* I quickly thought to myself.\n\nWhether it was from his overexertion at having failed to create a platinum forge in his maw, or the shock of this entire reveal, the Vunerian seemed to have finally reached his limits\u2026 as he outright fainted in front of us, dropping into a heaping pile of blue lizard.\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/yd3cu3/wearing_power_armor_to_a_magic_school_1/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1f6jflh/wearing_power_armor_to_a_magic_school_95/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1fhhha0/wearing_power_armor_to_a_magic_school_97/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Author\u2019s Note: Ilunor finally gets to see what Earth is capable of in a field that he holds near and dear to his heart!

This most certainly blows away Ilunor's mind and preconceptions, and it once again casts into question the Nexus' primacy and status as the sole superpower amongst the multiverse!

            "body": "\nPersonally, I believe that David Sneddon still remains in Pyongyang, North Korea and is used as an English tutor under the alias of \u201cYoon Bong Soo\u201d. This case has always interested me and it\u2019s a shame it\u2019s not received more attention. There is a good podcast episode i\u2019d recommend, the two part series by \u2018Unknown Passage podcast\u2019 and also the thin air podcast where they brought along David\u2019s father on air.  \n\n\nMr. Sneddon, then a 24 year old student at Brigham Young University in Utah disappeared in August 2004, while hiking in the Tiger Leaping Gorge in China\u2019s Yunnan Province. Fluent in Korean and speaking some Chinese, he was sightseeing before heading home to Utah and graduate school after finishing a two-year mission for his church in South Korea.\n\nThe local Chinese authorities first informed U.S. officials and the Sneddon family that David had most likely fallen into the river and drowned to death while hiking through the gorge. However, the family\u2019s own investigation soon afterward confirmed that David had finished his trek and been seen in a restaurant beyond the end of the gorge.\n\nHis disappearance immediately thereafter was not explained, although a number of factors indicated a North Korean connection. First, North Korean agents were actively operating in the area at the time with the acquiescence of Chinese officials, detaining North Korean \ndefectors and their suspected supporters. Second, Charles R. Jenkins, a U.S. soldier who deserted to North Korea in 1965 and was used by the regime to teach English to North Korean officials and agents, left North Korea one month before David\u2019s disappearance. David\u2019s youth and fluency in English and Korean would have made him particularly appealing as a replacement candidate. Third, Japanese specialists on North Korea affiliated with the National Association for the Rescue of Japanese Kidnapped by North Korea (NARKN) obtained information from reliable sources in China that in August, 2004, an American student closely matching David\u2019s description was detained by Chinese authorities who were observed to release him into the hands of \nNorth Korean agents.\n\nIn September last year, the U.S. and U.K. media quoted Mr. Choi to report that Mr. Sneddon turned up alive in North Korea after being kidnapped to serve as Kim Jong Un\u2019s personal English tutor in August 2004 while he was traveling Yunnan province, China. Since then, both the Senate and the House of Representatives of the U.S. passed a resolution urging action to find out what happened to Sneddon. North Korea strongly denied kidnapping him.\nIt is said that the U.S. embassy has been requested Mr. Choi the current state of Mr. Sneddon and further information to decisively confirm\u200e his identity up until now. According to North Korean sources, Sneddon has been relocated to Mt. Myohyang and is under special surveillance after foreign press reports, and was spotted at the Chosun Red Cross Hospital and Pongsu Church in Pyongyan before being relocated.\nAccording to Choi, sources in North Korea told him that then North Korean leader Kim Jong Il made a special order in 2004 to find a tutor to teach English and American culture to his children. Sources also said that the overseas political dissident division of the State Security Department and staffs deployed to Myanmar kidnapped Sneddon and brought him to Pyongyang in October 2004.\nNow, Mr. Sneddon goes by the Korean name Yoon Bong Soo and he is married to a woman named Kim Eun Hae and they have two children, a boy and a girl. Mr. Choi argued that such a story was revealed by a person who was involved in the kidnapping of Mr. Sneddon and he confessed Mr. Choi\u2019s North Korean source before he was dead.\n\nThey have met with a multitude of NGOs, human rights advocates, Japanese government officials - who are convinced David is a victim of kidnapping by the hermit state.\n\n\"Our latest information on David's case points to David's likely abduction by elements of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea),\" says a post from August last year. \"We believe he is now being held captive there.\"\n\nThe Sneddons are bruised by the lack of interest from the US Department of State, which maintains there is not \"credible evidence\" David was abducted. They presume their story \"doesn't fit the narrative\" the department wants for US-China relations.\n\n\"The 'credible evidence' David was drowned in the gorge was the Chinese said that's what happened,\" says Roy.\n\n\"They've never really investigated a lot of material,\" adds Kathleen. \"They may have been investigating it privately. That's my hope, that they're silently working on it.\"\n\nHer husband is less patient. \"If you're suddenly thrown off a ship and pray a dolphin will come and give you a ride, you're probably best off to start swimming yourself,\" says Roy.\n\n\"We decided we'd try swimming ourselves. There's so much politics, it's difficult.\"\n\nKathleen trusts her son is probably safe for now, but her eyes are wide open to the dangers and she sees clear reasons why their son might not have been able to contact them for all these years.\n\n\"If [Kim Jong-un] didn't like David anymore, he'd be killed,\" she says. \"The internet is absolutely closed in North Korea. Some people may have access to a phone from China, but he probably doesn't want to jeopardise himself and his wife and children.\n\n\"If any one of our children had to be abducted and cope with a difficult situation, it's David. He has great personal belief, on the inside he's very strong.\n\n\"I just want to run up to him, hug him and get to know his wife and children.\"\n\nDespite their desperation to see their son again, the Sneddons have also found room in their hearts to feel deeply for the North Korean people. \"It's such an evil and repressive empire,\" says Kathleen. \"I hope David is freed and something happens and these people will be freed.\"\n\nAs they watch the pressure on North Korea increase over its repressive regime and nuclear testing, they wonder if their \"adjustable\" son could even play a vital role in a transition.\n\n\"I'd like to think, in the long run, David could be a blessing to the people of North Korea,\" says Kathleen. \"I hope David can move mountains.\" She laughs. \"We're both dreamers.\"\n\nRoy interjects: \"I don't think we are. I believe Kim Jong-un's regime will fall. It won't happen because the US sends an aircraft carrier, it'll be because people watching in positions of power say, enough is enough.\"\n\n\nArticles quoted\nhttps://japan-forward.com/u-s-japan-cooperation-expected-on-passage-of-congressional-resolution-on-david-sneddon-disappearance-2/amp/\n\nhttps://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/north-koreas-other-otto-the-unbelievable-story-of-missing-hiker-david-sneddon/IJONS7MFM4CRIVESUHBBPH2J5A/",

I don't know much about them and would like to know Israel's justification for them, as I'm sure you must have \"your side.\"\n\nFrom my point of view, it's already suspect that anti-Israel people want to jump on the UN declaration of \"illegal\" for the settlements but have no problem with the fact that Arab Palestinians ignored the UN's two-state decision in the first place and ultimately attacked Israel.

These settlements cost millions to protect and maintain due to the security risks. There is often violence between Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank which is not always dealt with fairly by the IDF. The risks in Gaza of extremist movements, especially after a war, is very high. \n\n2-If Israel chooses to annex part or all of the Gaza Strip and builds settlements without allowing Palestinians to return the allegations of ethnic cleansing will be correct. They were displaced for their own safety during the war but refusing to allow them to return would mean they were ethnically cleansed.\n\n3- Israel is in the process of normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia which would be a great ally for them against Iran. Settling the Gaza Strip could jeopardize this deal. \n\n4-Israel is surrounded by enemies and must try to maintain relations with the only two neutral countries nearby (Jordan and Egypt). Re-settling Gaza could fuel ideas of Israeli expansionism and militarism which may damage their relationship with these nations. \n\n5- The settlements in the West Bank have significantly increased tensions with the PA and are often used by anti Israel activists to promote the idea that Israel doesn\u2019t want peace. They have very little benefit to Israeli society overall. Regardless of what you think of the PA they\u2019re still the government in the West Bank and Israel needs to try to work with them. \n\n6-The costs associated with ensuring that there are no more extremists groups in Gaza like Hamas would be significantly increase with an Israeli civilian population present in the territory. \n\n7-It may be necessary to build fences or gates to separate these settlements from other Palestinian communities making travel between Israel and Gaza very challenging and dangerous. Many around the world could also see this as an unjust system. \n\nAre there any counterpoints to these? What do Israelis think? Only a small minority in Israel think the same thing as Smotrovich and Ben Gvir luckily. ",

I don't want to get into all of the reasons but I do want to clarify for you:\n\nIn \"I Would Like To Solve the Puzzle - Roaring Kitty's 2024 Gamestop Play\", **I relied too heavily on my speculated narrative of various memes and tweets to try and create a story that fit GME's price movement.** I realized soon after I made that post that I could have unintentionally caused damage to innocent people who love the stock as much as we do and just love to buy it.\n\nI believe that I and other GME lovers need to be **far more careful** when any public figure is brought into our speculation. After MOASS, the entire U.S. and possibly the world will be looking to us to blame. **We are completely innocent in this fucked up situation and I don't want to give any reason for the righteous fury of future economic victims to be steered towards the GME community.**\n\nThat being said, if by coincidence or sheer luck, I believe **I have finally understood why certain price action occurs for our favorite stock.**\n\nI will be re-iterating some portions of my original post for context; however...\n\n**I want this post to be far less focused on meme speculation and more focused on what I call \"FTD Settlement Period Limits\" and how we can use them to accurately predict price movement in the event of great and sudden purchase volume.**\n\n# It's Not Delivery, It's DiGiorno! - Failure to Deliver\n\n**Before Starting**\n\nThe T in T+X stands for **Trade Date. It is not to delineate Trading Days.**\n\nThe trade date is the date that you submit a purchase and it \"completes\" through your broker.\n\nAnyone who is using C+35 for *any reason*, please **break that habit and start using T+35** when referring to Market Maker/Authorized Participant FTD settlements.\n\nThe difference between Calendar Days and Trade Days is related to the specific privilege given only to Market Makers and Authorized Participants. Only these massive institutions are given this exclusive 35 **Calendar** **Day** extension.\n\n**Market Makers must follow the small player's Trade Date limits until they hit those limits. THEN they swap to a calendar day countdown that includes the previous calendar days they have already used up. 35 Calendar days and the pre-market following the 35th day (more on that below) is the absolute limit they can avoid buying shares from specific trade dates.**\n\n**-**\n\nFirst off, I want to immediately make a correction to my previous post.\n\nIn my first post, I relied on the format of T+35+Bank Holidays to explain price movements corresponding with possible large stock purchase dates.\n\n**This format is incorrect. Bank Holidays are considered a normal calendar day. Market Makers/Authorized Participants do not receive extensions for each Bank Holiday.**\n\n**\\*Edit\\*** The above statement is true; however, in the rare case of a large FTD settlement happening to land directly on a Bank Holiday, that *may* extend the FTD settlement period, or possibly even shorten it by that one day.\n\nMy previous thinking was that the entire point of the T+35 exemption time period was intended to allow more possible \"settlement\" days to be available for a Market Maker/Authorized Participant. It seemed counter intuitive for Bank Holidays to remove those possible settlement days. **However, I could not find any documentation confirming Bank Holidays further extend the T+35.** Therefore, I must assume that my previous format is **incorrect.**\n\nSo what does this change? Actually, almost nothing. **In fact, this allowed me to finally understand what is going on with this stock.** Let me explain why.\n\nIt turns out I missed a crucial factor regarding the T+35 Market Maker/Authorized Participant settlement exemption period:\n\n>*...the participant must close out a fail to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than* ***the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date***\\*, referred to as T+4...\\*\n\nSource: Rule 204 of Regulation SHO [https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm)\n\nIn simplified terms, Market Makers and Authorized Participants have until the end of **Pre-Market on the morning following the settlement period limit.** T+3 is the last day of **Regular Trading Hours** that they can purchase; however, they are allowed to instead use **Pre-Market of the following day.** The SEC refers to this special privilege as T+4 even though its really more like T+3 and 1/2 or even less. (Extra note, I swear it feels like the SEC still uses T+3 almost everywhere else when talking about settlement for MMs and APs. I don't know what is up with that.)\n\n**This also applies to their T+35 day limit as the Pre-Market of the next trade day following their 35 days is NOT considered \"regular trading hours.\"**\n\nThe full **(albeit very simplified)** Market Maker/Authorized Participant's flow chart for a purchase would look like this:\n\n>Purchase order comes into the Market Maker's queue from a Broker\n\n>Market Maker does not buy the share that day\n\n>3 Trading Days pass.\n\n>Market Maker can choose to purchase in Pre-Market of the following Trade Day but decides **not** to. The limit is then pushed to T+6.\n\n>3 more Trading Days pass.\n\n>Market Maker can choose to purchase in Pre-Market on the following Trade Day but decides not to.\n\n>Market Maker now enters T+35 special extension. All of the previous calendar days that have passed since the Trade Date retroactively count towards this 35 calendar day count.\n\n>The 35th calendar day has arrived, the Settlement Period Limit has nearly been reached. The Market Maker REALLY doesn't want to buy that share.\n\n>Market Maker pushes it to the very last moment by NOT purchasing on Calendar day 35. **Instead, they buy during Pre-Market on the next Trading Day.**\n\n\\*EDIT\\* The flowchart above uses \"Market Maker\" in place of the actual counterparties. In reality, these FTDs are most likely being passed from counterparty to counterparty further up the chain until it lands on the Market Maker's queue after Pre-Market of T+6. Since extending to T+35 seems to be the default behavior for shorting Gamestop through ETFs like XRT, I simplified the flowchart by just inserting the Market Maker.\n\nLet me show you an even more simple example of this flowchart on the *actual* chart. I will only bother using T+35. Why not? That's all the Market Makers seem to use.\n\nThe start dates for this period are as follows:\n\n3/28, 4/1, 4/2 all in 2024.\n\nWe can calculate the Settlement Period Limit using T+35 and throw in Pre-Market for each date.\n\n5/2-3(Pre-Market), 5/3-4(Pre-Market), 5/7-8(Pre-Market) all in 2024.\n\n[Small Price Settlement Period 3\\/28-4\\/2 Through To 5\\/2-5\\/8 \\(Pre-Market\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ifbbv8yynj7d1.png?width=1896&format=png&auto=webp&s=633d6b9b1e88994af86fecaad804c285671ac179)\n\nThe price scale may be small, but the percentage gain is impressive over this 35 day period.\n\nOn the left we have an extended downtrend in the price over a multi day period. 35 calendar days later we have a large upward movement. **You might be thinking that the upward movement seems too large for those 3 days of FTDs, but FTDs are only half of the puzzle**. I'll explain the second half in the next section.\n\nFor most of us that have trouble with chart analysis it may be difficult to spot normal(ish) price action vs a spike in Naked Shorting that leads to FTD accumulation. For anyone that is interested in looking into the past, I would suggest looking for an extended multi-day period of price dropping. If there is a multi-day *harsh* downtrend on no news/announcements, **there is a higher chance that they are just refusing to complete a large portion of buy orders over those days.**\n\nTo wrap this section up, I will leave the entire Rule 204 of Regulation SHO here for you:\n\n>*Rule 204 \u2014 Close-out Requirements.*\u00a0Under Rule 204, participants of a registered clearing agency (as defined in section 3(a)(24) of the Exchange Act) must deliver securities to a registered clearing agency for clearance and settlement on a long or short sale transaction in any equity security by settlement date, or must close out a fail to deliver in any equity security for a long or short sale transaction in that equity security generally by the times described as follows: the participant must close out a fail to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+4; if a participant has a fail to deliver that the participant can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale, or that is attributable to bona-fide market making activities, the participant must close out the fail to deliver by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+6. In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in \u201cthreshold securities\u201d if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days. Threshold securities, as defined by Rule 203(c)(6), are generally equity securities with large and persistent fails to deliver.\n\nSource: [https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm)\n\nAnd here is the SECs very poor attempt at an ELI5:\n\n>Rule 204 provides an extended period of time to close out certain failures to deliver. Specifically, if a failure to deliver position results from the sale of a security that a person is deemed to own and that such person intends to deliver as soon as all restrictions on delivery have been removed, the firm has up to 35 calendar days following the trade date to close out the failure to deliver position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity. Such additional time is warranted and does not undermine the goal of reducing failures to deliver because these are sales of owned securities that cannot be delivered by the settlement date due solely to processing delays outside the seller\u2019s or broker-dealer\u2019s control. Moreover, delivery is required to be made on such sales as soon as all restrictions on delivery have been removed and situations where a person is deemed to own a security are limited to those specified in Rule 200 of Regulation SHO. A common example of a deemed to own security that cannot be delivered by the settlement date is a security subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933.\n\nSource: [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm)\n\n# Settlers of Catan - Gamma Ramp\n\nIn the previous small price example, the price increase after T+35 seemed to far outweigh the price loss from Naked Shorting. Why is that?\n\nIt was due to two major factors.\n\n1. **Bull's Entry Point** - Gamestop's stock had experienced a major downtrend over several years. Volume was miniscule as the price had reached an extreme low of near $10 (Post-Split). This, along with several other TA indicators alerted both small and large investors that **Gamestop's stock was at a perfect entry point to buy back in.**\n\n[Close-To-Perfect Entry Point Was The Week of 4\\/20\\/2024 \\(lmao\\)](https://preview.redd.it/dy2miajmrj7d1.png?width=1897&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f6f950c9872c3ead790d9e94d0dd4bee872496d)\n\n2. **More Investors = More Options = Gamma Ramp -** Both small and large investors began scooping up call options for absurdly low prices. More open call contracts causes the *potential* for increased options hedging.\n\nBut, depending on the strike prices chosen, the price won't drastically rise on it's own. If the price doesn't rise enough, the Options writers won't need to hedge which means a Gamma ramp isn't going to happen on it's own. **It needs a spark to ignite it.**\n\n**That is where the real power of FTDs is on display and this why the Market Makers and Authorized Participants naked shorting Gamestop are in DEEP shit.**\n\nLet's have a look at that first example again but this time let's double check the dates of the Settlement Period Limit.\n\n[5\\/1-5\\/3 = Wednesday - Friday](https://preview.redd.it/39ly2gfntj7d1.png?width=1896&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b108d060a3aee986467619cd94c8af88af8ca65)\n\nIt is my opinion that we are looking at a mini gamma ramp triggered by a higher-than-normal amount of options contracts being pushed Into-The-Money by FTD settlement.\n\nMarket Makers are being forced to settle their FTDs leading right into the **end of week options expiration.** Thousands of options are pushed ITM due to the abnormal purchase volume from the FTD settlement. More options being pushed further ITM causes Options Writers to purchase more shares to hedge for their potential losses causing a Gamma Squeeze. **This is how a \"small\" amount of FTDs can have a massive impact on price.** And it is exactly what we saw in January of 2021.\n\n[Ryan Cohen's 12\\/17-12\\/18 Purchase Settles](https://preview.redd.it/fx7nhopn2l7d1.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=06939c751f0d27f4b6ee29af63c991831aaa7298)\n\nRyan Cohen saw Gamestop as a possible turnaround story and pursued a stake in the Company.\n\nHis purchase Trade Dates are as follows:\n\n12/17/2020 - Purchased 470,311 (Split Adjusted = 1,881,244)  \n12/18/2020 - Purchased 500,000 (Split Adjusted = 2,000,000)  \n12/18/2020 - Purchased 256,089 (Split Adjusted = 1,024,356)\n\nTotals: 1,226,400 (Split Adjusted = 4,905,600)\n\nSource: [https://fintel.io/n/cohen-ryan](https://fintel.io/n/cohen-ryan)\n\nT+35 Calendar days from 12/17 and 12/18 would place his FTD settlement period limit at 1/21-23(Pre-Market)\n\nAbove you can see the sudden upward movement of the stock followed by an explosive price change. on January 23rd, 2020 in Pre-market.\n\nHere are the values:\n\n1/21/2021 - Opened at $9.81 Closed at $10.76 | Percentage Gain From Previous Close: 10.02%  \n1/22/2021- Opened at $10.65 | Closed at $16.25 | Percentage Gain From Previous Close: **51.03%**  \n1/23/2021 - Settlement Period Limit reached at 9:29am EST.

The week of January 11th, the stock opened at $4.85(Post-Split) it closed the week at $8.88(Post-Split). **That is an 83% gain from open on Monday to close on Friday.**\n\nIt would be speculation to say that there may have been emergency calls/meetings held for these Market Makers and Authorized Participants; however, **I can confidently guess that the decision was made to open the following week HARD on Naked Shorting.** Monday and Tuesday (1/19 and 1/20), the price hardly moved as this shorting occurred. Hardly any shares were purchased by the Market maker to cover any non-options related orders. **Bear in mind volume was over 100 million shares each day that week (Post-Split).**\n\nOnce the FTDs from Ryan Cohen's purchase came due, millions of shares had to be purchased sending the stock price higher and higher. Options Writers quickly began purchasing more and more shares to hedge their losses. The resulting Gamma Squeeze sent the stock **parabolic**.\n\nAs soon as the momentum from the Gamma Squeeze was exhausted, mass options sell offs occurred beginning a general down trend; however, Market Makers were not happy with a \"general downtrend.\" They needed Gamestop dropped and fast.\n\n[January 29th and February 1st Incredible Naked Shorting](https://preview.redd.it/3untl3ez7k7d1.png?width=1635&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b13b30b81ae35353ac0693584fb3b43f89b011f)\n\n**The buy button was removed and the fall from the Gamma Squeeze was so absurdly quick that even** ***amateur*** **investors could tell something HISTORICALLY criminal just occurred.**\n\nAny short institution with a stake in Gamestop that COULD Naked Short this stock did so through it's entire fall after the initial Gamma Squeeze.\n\nWith fewer brokers able to purchase Gamestop due to the Clearing House restriction put in place just after the Gamma Squeeze peak, institutions at lower levels waited for their usual T+3 settlement limit hoping to buy at a lower price point. Market Makers and Authorized Participants Naked Shorted every share they could creating a massive ball of FTDs on a T+35 Calendar Day clock. **All this effort to stop the stock from resting at a MUCH higher base price and to prevent margin calls from forcing them to close long dated short positions.**\n\nTheir collusion worked temporarily as the price plummeted back to the low price of around $10 (Post Split). This most likely allowed them time to breath and re-position to survive what came next. Their extension for FTDs expired and the stock rocketed back up due to their required buy ins scheduled for late February.\n\n**Each subsequent run up and run down is a re-run of this exact situation played at a slightly smaller scale each time.** Over time as more and more public investors (large, small, and institutional) lose interest/hope for the stock, less and less purchases are made and fewer shares need to be marked as FTD. Eventually, Market makers managed to return the stock to a very low price and have relative control over it's movement. **That is, until 2024.**\n\nDue to my understanding of the initial Gamma Squeeze in 2021 and it's subsequent run ups:\n\n**I believe that the key to Gamestop's release from the unlawful PRISON that is ABUSIVE naked shorting is the occurrence of multiple back-to-back gamma ramps each ignited by the Market Maker's Failure to Deliver abuse.**\n\n# Entering The Volume - Volume Inflation\n\nI believe this has already been covered, but I wanted to create a small section just as a *reminder* of why Gamestop has such absurd levels of volume over the course of months.\n\nWe have often seen mentions of the volume easily exceeding the available float of Gamestop's shares. **A big reason for that is due to FTDs. Every single FTD counts as a minimum of 2 volume per share.**\n\nWhen an investor purchases shares through a Broker, they are added to that day's volume. The purchaser is told they have the shares in their account even though the purchase has not affected the price value. T+35 days later, the Market Maker will *actually* purchase the share, adding 1 to the volume for the day they purchased it.\n\nThis causes Gamestop's volume to inflate on a larger time scale. Looking at 3 months of volume, you will be unknowingly seeing **a portion of volume that has been doubled** due to FTD settlement.\n\n# Dark - The Future of the Cycle\n\nEarlier, I mentioned that Bullish investors were buying back into Gamestop in late April.\n\nGamestop's stock is on an uptrend and is garnering more interest from the pool of public investors. The more momentum Gamestop's stock has, the more purchasing occurs which means **more FTDs accumulating.** **If these FTDs happen to line up correctly,** they may reach their Settlement Period Limit later in the month, specifically on the 3rd Friday the **week of options and futures expirations.**\n\n>*Triple witching hour is the last hour of the stock market trading session (3:00-4:00 P.M., New York City local Time) on the third Friday of every March,* ***June***\\*, September, and December. Those days are the expiration of three kinds of securities:\\*\n\n>\n\n>*Stock market index futures;*\n\n>*Stock market index options;*\n\n>*Stock options.*\n\n>*The simultaneous expirations generally increases the trading volume of options, futures, and their underlying stocks, occasionally increasing the volatility of prices of related securities.*\n\nSource: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple\\_witching\\_hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_witching_hour)\n\n**The FTD purchasing along with Options and Futures contracts expiring could compound into a massive Gamma Squeeze of a similar or even larger movement than the original 2021 Sneeze.**\n\nAll that it would need is a decent amount of FTDs' Settlement Period Limits **to coincide with the same week if we were lucky, maybe the same DAY** if we were here for a *reckoning*.\n\nBut for that, we would need large investors with 100's of millions of dollars to buy into Gamestop all because they believe it is a great investment opportunity.\n\n**Thankfully, we have possibly the most downright insane investor on Gamestop's side, DeepFuckingValue** AKA Roaring Kitty. Roaring Kitty may be crazy (aren't we all?), but he is also an *incredibly* smart trader.\n\n\\*SPECULATION AHEAD\\*\n\nI believe that DFV has taken advantage of the recent run-up/run-down to further his position and he MAY have made a large purchase 5/16/2024 while the stock was heading down from a recent large movement.\n\n[May 16th DFV Possible Re-Entry After Selling April Calls](https://preview.redd.it/3ssfyiv1ek7d1.png?width=1833&format=png&auto=webp&s=0df6e1e9ce17d929d4e0809697715ac5dbe58ee2)\n\n*\"E\\*Trade Considers Kicking Meme-Stock Leader Keith Gill Off Platform\"*\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/e-trade-considers-kicking-meme-stock-leader-keith-gill-off-platform-f2003ec4](https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/e-trade-considers-kicking-meme-stock-leader-keith-gill-off-platform-f2003ec4)\n\nIn the above article (pay-walled, sorry), E-Trade has potentially broken Broker-to-Trader privacy regulations and leaked that DFV had purchased options previous to his social media return.\n\nDue to the timing of Roaring Kitty's memes this year, it is my belief that DFV DID purchase options in April and sold them at or near the peak of May 15th. He then used the profits from that sale to purchase shares on the way down on 5/16/2024.\n\nOn Roaring Kitty's stream, he showed off how accurate the bull flag was to the bottom of the original Gamestop 2021 Sneeze. I believe that **Roaring Kitty predicted the stock would eventually bottom out to around this same price and chose a price near** **the bottom as his re-entry price.**\n\n[\\\\\"This is all a Test\\\\\" - Roaring Kitty most likely referring to \\\\\"Testing Support\\\\\" on the Gamestop chart](https://preview.redd.it/ea6xhihjik7d1.png?width=952&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a19547faed16aff5af32ff62dd7621f3e3c0218)\n\n**I speculate that Roaring Kitty entered into additional positions slightly above the support level of $10.**\n\nTrading done in the previous 3 years as well as this new position would have his cost basis be **substantially** lowered from his original $55.17. He has purchased 4.8 million shares in the past 3 years and **we know that he averaged down HARD.**\n\nIt is possible that DFV purchased a large portion of his 5 Million shares near the bottom. If true, his purchase must have been large enough that Market Makers and Authorized Participants did **NOT** want to fulfill the order immediately. Instead, they used their T+35 Calendar Day special exemption to extend their delivery time.\n\nAt some point either slightly before or after his purchase, DFV decided that the stock has *definitely* bottomed out and he then loaded up on call options to take advantage of the eventual upward movement.\n\nThis leads us to the May run up. DFV's original stock purchase slightly above Gamestop's support line has now come due T+35 days later. The FTDs are settled for what could potentially be millions of share purchases. The purchases drive investor's options In-The-Money, sparking a Gamma Squeeze. DFV notices the price action, sells his options purchase near the peak and tries to find a good entry point as the stock is moving down after the Gamma Squeeze is exhausted.\n\nMy theory is that he **MAY** have made a purchase on May 16th 2024 as the math on his current cost basis could be averaging up after his large purchase in April.\n\nI am using this tool to do very basic math for the cost basis:\n\n[https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/stock-average](https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/stock-average)\n\nJust as one example: In April, if DFV had managed to purchase the majority of his large position at $16, that would allow for a new purchase on May 16th at $28 to create a VERY similar cost basis of $21.33 vs his original June 2024 cost basis of $21.27. That is a $.06 difference while only using round price points for exit and entry.\n\nI personally believe that DFV could have purchased in April at an even lower price point. The lower you use for his April purchase, the higher he may have purchased on May 16th.\n\n*Disclaimer: Calculating cost basis is not as simple as I am depicting. This is just a scarcely detailed example to get my point across that this is a potential timeline of events. I am also did* ***not*** *try to perfectly re-create DFV's entire purchase history, I just used recent purchases to illustrate my point.*\n\n**But why does any of this matter?**\n\nBecause if Roaring Kitty DID purchase on May 16th, it may have been a **substantial** purchase. Far too large for Market Makers or Authorized Participants to move off exchange. They clearly have a history of just delaying the purchase, so I am willing to bet that they have Naked Shorted here again. T+35 from May 16th, 2024 is June 20th, 2024. Market Makers are allowed to further extend the deadline until Pre-Market of the next day, June 21st, 2024.\n\n**We have potentially been gifted a massive run-up on June 21st by Market Makers and Authorized Participants' extreme abuse of FTDs via Naked Short Selling. All of this because one small cat LOVES this damn stock.**\n\n# Exercise Machine - Exercising VS Purchasing\n\n*This topic was included in my original post. I will be adding an edited version and including it here for important context.*\n\nI see many people going back and forth on whether DFV purchased shares directly or exercised some of his call options on June 13th, 2024.\n\nI am here to tell you **he almost certainly did not exercise.**\n\nEnough time has passed for us to know with near certainty that he has not exercised.\n\nPer the Options Clearing Corporation:\n\n>If it's an equity or ETF weekly option, exercise notices tendered on any business day will result in delivery of the underlying shares on the second (T+2)\\* business day following exercise. Index options are cash-settled on the next business day following exercise.\n\n*Edit* I think the OCC website was updated just today to reflect CAT changes. Options exercise delivery is now T+1.\n\nExercising options is very different from purchasing stock directly and apes are wise to recognize that purchasing options and exercising them allows retail to **actually affect the market price directly.** It essentially bypasses the T+35 day waiting period for our purchase to hit the market. To my knowledge, they do not and cannot delay settlement past T+2 for per options regulating restrictions.\n\nHowever, DFV's transaction on June 13th would have **definitely** hit the market by now.\n\nSince we have seen next to no upward pressure since his purchase, I would assume that he instead sold his options for cash on June 12th. The updated Open Interest dropped by a massive amount after market close. Roaring Kitty then posted his Dune tweet at 2PM EST on June 13th, and in my opinion, this is him excitedly posting that he just purchased the 4,001,000 shares. Can't imagine what that feels like. After hours on June 13th, DFV then posted his updated position confirming that he holds 4,001,000 additional shares.\n\nIf you need more solid evidence that DFV did **NOT** exercise, here is Dave Lauer's tweets with another user stating that they view this as an options sale to purchase more shares. Please remember Dave has been in the industry for **years**. Yes, he can make mistakes, but he is **NOT** an amateur investor trying to spread FUD.\n\n[Dave Lauer on DFV's new Yolo](https://preview.redd.it/micri3ifpk7d1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6c03dced340a90f938b157178d37e586fa9c848)\n\nA large part of the discussion seems to center around Premium cost factoring into cost basis.\n\n**Dave's years of trading experience has led him to believe that Options Premium costs are not factored into your cost basis, only the Option's Strike Price.**\n\nSo a trader reached out to DFV's Broker, E-Trade, to clarify if they factor in a premium cost to a position's cost basis in your account position portal.\n\n[E-Trade Does NOT Factor in Premiums to Cost Basis](https://preview.redd.it/pucdpmdypk7d1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=80708afd66cb414e55aaa0e7ce2bf59d2d36159a)\n\n**E-Trade reported that they ONLY use the Options Strike Price to adjust your Cost Basis.**\n\n**DFV** ***almost certainly\\**** **did NOT exercise his call options.**\n\n**\\*EDIT\\* \\***  \nSeveral of you have reached out to me with doubts regarding E-Trade factoring in premiums for options cost basis. I agree with all of you that it seems like an odd choice to leave them out. So I wanted to include my opinion here:\n\nIn my mind, the chances of DFV exercising vs purchasing direct stock are at *least* an equal stalemate.\n\nThe math on his cost basis can be reached in either situation, so we need to look at other variables to make a decision.\n\nIf DFV exercised early, he lost out on many days of theta value. Selling his calls and then buying directly would net him *substantially* more shares than exercising too early. In the past, DFV has exercised his options by allowing them to expire ITM. It is my personal view that, if he wanted to exercise while the price action was relatively normal, he would have used this same method of allowing them to expire ITM.\n\nSome people will say that his decision to exercise early was a part of some plan; however, T+1 has passed for the Exercised Securities Settlement Period Limit and nothing has happened. If exercising was his plan, it did not seem to work.\n\n>**Exercise Settlement Time:**\u00a0\u00a0Exercise notices tendered on any business day will result in delivery of the underlying stock on the first (T+1) business day following exercise.\n\nSource: [https://www.theocc.com/clearance-and-settlement/clearing/equity-options-product-specifications](https://www.theocc.com/clearance-and-settlement/clearing/equity-options-product-specifications)\n\nIt is my personal opinion that DFV *does* have a plan to ride out the 2024 Gamestop action and selling his calls to buy the most shares possible seems to benefit him the most.\n\nCoincidentally, it also can benefit us.\n\n\n\nSince DFV is a trader that loves to interact with a community, he often **publicly posts his positions**. Now that DFV is a *whale,* a direct stock purchase that he makes on the market is almost *guaranteed* to be **millions of shares of FTDs**. With knowledge of the date of his purchase, we can make an estimate on when his purchase will *actually* affect the share price and take a position in the stock to benefit off of it. This unique set of circumstances is ONLY possible because one MASSIVE whale LOVES this stock *and* **Market Makers and Authorized Participants are ILLEGALY ABUSING THEIR RIGHTS TO NAKED SHORT.**\n\nDFV's *near confirmed* June purchase date is June 13th, 2024.\n\n**T+35 Calendar Days would put his direct stock purchase hitting the market on July 18th. However, Market Makers will most likely wait until the last minute by pushing it to Pre-Market of Friday, July 19th, 2024.**\n\nI personally believe that DFV's *unconfirmed* May purchase date is May 16th, 2024,\n\n**T+35 Calendar Days would put his direct stock purchase hitting the market on June 20th. However, Market Makers will most likely wait until the last minute by pushing it to Pre-Market of Friday, June 21st, 2024.**\n\n# Conclusion - On the Shoulders of Giants\n\nThank you to anyone that stuck through and read this post!\n\nThe Gamestop saga is one **hell** of a ride and I personally cannot wait for GME to break free of it's Naked Short prison and fly free.\n\nIt is impossible for me to list everyone who has contributed DD to Superstonk but I am completely serious when I say that I am standing on the shoulders of absolute **GIANTS.** And those giants are standing on other giants ~~that are standing on other giants that also stand on giants that are all standing on Rick of Spades.~~\n\nSeriously, 5 years ago if you told me that I would be spending time the equivalent of a full workday to write about this kind of shit in the stock market, I would have asked you to leave me alone.\n\nOver three years of DD and chart watching must have formed a nice new wrinkle in my ape brain and that is thanks to all of you here at Superstonk.\n\n**My understanding of this situation may need additional expanding or some small corrections; however, I believe I have at least nailed down what has caused this stock to behave so bizarrely starting from January 2021.**\n\n**-**\n\nWith all of that said, I would like to put money in mouth:\n\n[doxxed my account number because I am truly regarded. Edited Position Picture](https://preview.redd.it/hkk0dx1ndl7d1.png?width=1419&format=png&auto=webp&s=38d3a7ea51e8a43fab386f1d0309f1bfc2e01ec8)\n\n**This ugly fucking nightmare of a position is mine.**\n\nI currently have 2,200 shares worth of leverage. I also have a bit more buying power left. Assuming the price stays relatively low on Thursday, I plan to purchase additional contracts for June 21st.\n\nI want to make one thing **VERY** clear:\n\nJune 21st may or MAY NOT run up due to an FTD Settlement Period Limit+Gamma Hedging Squeeze.\n\nI am LESS confident about June 21st than I am about July 19th.\n\nThe July 19th date is based off of two *nearly confirmed* data points: DFV publicly posted that he purchased a large amount of shares on June 13th, 2024. Even though we cannot be *absolutely* sure he purchased them *on that day* I believe due to his past posts, that **he is honest with the community**.\n\nJune 21st only has my ***best estimate*** of DFV's May purchase. **If my guess is wrong, I could lose all of the money I have poured into premiums for that ugly bastard of an options position that I call my own.**\n\nPurchasing 1-2 Day To Expiry Options Contracts is historically a DumbFuckingMove\u2122 and I do NOT recommend following me into **this risky as hell gamble.**\n\nIf you *are* like me and believe that the FTD Settlement Limit Periods are driving the stock movement, **it would be MUCH safer to bet on July 19th, 2024** as we have a much better idea of the exact purchase date our resident whale bought his shares on. I even have a small amount of money set aside as a backup in case my May purchase date theory is wrong and I will use that to essentially YOLO into July 19th, 2024 Expiry, or possibly the week after, July 26th, 2024.\n\n*EDIT* Wanted to add this. PLEASE be aware how risky June 21st options are. The company completed a MASSIVE share offering in the middle of my May-June timeline. It is entirely possible that Market Makers used this offering to offset FTD settlement. It is also possible that Market Makers doubled down and added additional Naked Shorts during this offering. This is gamble I am taking.\n\nSome have asked me how I feel about DRS. I will let this speak for itself:\n\n[I deeply regret not YOLOing in for more shares during the $10-$12 dollar range...](https://preview.redd.it/0wo8u04xal7d1.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3d86705507f339f9ba1e77e9dc2b2a809ab8521)\n\nI could not find a good spot to fit this into the post, but I did want to remind everyone that June 21st 2024 is the farthest dated LEAPS from January 2021. This may be an additional factor to consider as, anyone that was trying to reposition their options contracts *may* have chosen the farthest available date on the chain.\n\nOh and a neat trick I learned the other day...\n\nAs long as you have enough cash in your Options trading account, In-The-Money Options contracts **automatically exercise** by 5PM on the expiration date. (At least for Fidelity.)\n\nI thought that was kind of neat.\n\n**SMALL ASIDE REGARDING FTD DATA RELEASES**\n\nThe adjustments of my prediction for DFV's may purchase **completely invalidates** my previous theory about FTD reporting in my last post \"I Would Like To Solve the Puzzle - T+3, T+6, T+35\".\n\nIf I had to guess at why our FTD data is pretty much a crapshoot, I would reach for the utterly *classic* line of \"this data is self reported and cannot be fully relied upon.\" *\\*chefs kiss\\**\n\nThose missing days are most likely just days that reported 0 FTDs for that day. Whether you believe that they are reporting honestly is up to you.\n\nLast, but not least. I thought to include my favorite song for all of you. Hopefully it will get you guys excited for Friday and remind you of all we are doing here in Superstonk.\n\n\"*We Don't Talk About Bruno\"*\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvWRMAU6V-c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvWRMAU6V-c)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o8o26x5a8l7d1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=028f38e0547d940333b9cc46cd23e84b3d36bad7",

It added a new dimension to the game, allowing players to create their own communities, complete with defenses, resources, and even thriving economies.\n\nBringing this system to Starfield could offer a similar experience but set against the backdrop of a vast and uncharted galaxy. Imagine exploring new planets, discovering resources, and then building your own outposts and colonies to stake your claim in the stars.\n\nHowever, some argue that the settlement system could detract from the core experience of exploration and discovery that Starfield promises. They worry that focusing too much on building settlements could take away from the sense of wonder and adventure that comes from exploring a new and unknown galaxy.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Bethesda bring back the settlement system in Starfield? Would it enhance the gameplay experience, or would it be a distraction from the game's main focus? Share your thoughts below!",

They have gone through so many family members with money not paid a dime back to any of them.  After I left my husband I moved back in with my mom thank God she had taken me in because I would have been homeless. I helped my mom with the bills, rent, and groceries for the house. Plus I was not getting any spousal support and taking care of my kids as well. I am working full time, taking care of my kids, see them every other weekend and their needs as well. Everything was fine until my sister 41f and her boyfriend 44M move in around December 2023 it was supposed to be temporary. \nShe was not paying for rent, utilities just for groceries.  My sister 41f owes me almost $5,000 for breaking her lease because I did not want to have an eviction on my credit. I have asked her to pay me back and she has not paid me a single dime. My mom 62F owes me almost $10,000 regarding past bills that I paid for. My mom has always expected a lot more from me being the older than my sister and my brother 38M. I feel like my mom has always helped my sister out when she has had issues and bailed her out of trouble. \nWell, January 2024 comes along and I applied for management job in my company working back office in a different city. I did give my mom plenty of notice that I was going to move out if I got the job promotion. I got the job promotion and when I was about to move out I gave my mom the rent that I was paying just for the days I stayed in the house. Once I moved out my sister had the audacity to ask me if I was going to pay the utilities after I had moved out from my mom\u2019s house! I said no because I paid what I had to. Well after that I had a conversation with my mom regarding about money she said I did not have to worry about it! It was my sister\u2019s doing. \n\nI am going through the settlement process and if they ask for any money the answer is no! AITA? \n\nUPDATE: I am going through the settlement process with my attorney this weekend. I moved to another city for my new job, getting settled in nicely. I do see my children and talk to them daily. I do talk to my mom small talk only and that is it! \nAs for my sister I have. Not spoke to her because she does not have accountability to anything! Not dealing with people like that! \n\nNo wonder why my brother moved away! ",

Obviously the money doesn\u2019t heal the trauma or come close to healing any wounds.\nI thought my family were people I could confide in and so I told them the exact amount of my settlement.\nSince then, it\u2019s been a shitshow. My brother has asked me to loan him money for him to buy a house, which is a hard no.\n\nMy mother has been the worst culprit. Every time we\u2019re out, she demands that I buy her things or pay for the bill. My younger sister is 21 and she wants a new car. Today, my mom was saying that it\u2019s super shitty and stingy of me to not offer to buy her one. WTFFF. \n\nShe says that I owe her because she would occasionally send me money for food a few years ago while I was in college. I worked my ass off in college as a swim instructor and as a waitress, but I struggled to pay rent and buy food in an expensive city. My mother has gone so far as to print all of her bank account records from the past five years to highlight every single time she has ever helped me with money while I was in college.\n\nI bought my mom $2000 worth of Botox and lip fillers for her birthday, yet she\u2019s always calling me selfish and cheap. She has my phone contact down as \u201ccheap ass bitch.\u201d \nShe wants me to financially support my other minor sister. Keep in mind, my mom was incredibly abusive growing up and I did not live with her as a teenager.\n\nToday, we got in an argument while I came to visit her. She was going to chic fil a with my sister and I asked if I could tag along, and she said she expected me to get the bill then. I used this as a basis to explain that I don\u2019t appreciate being expected to pay for everything all the time, and that it\u2019s hurtful. She then proceeds to tell me that I\u2019m selfish and going to die a miserable person. She grabbed my keys and threw them outside in the yard and asked me to leave..\n\nI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m at the point where I\u2019m so dumbfounded. Am I overreacting for thinking this is so disgusting and ridiculous?\nIs there anyway around keeping a relationship with my family members?\n\n I wanted to type up what my mom said to me today.. I woke up to an array of messages.\n\u201cI really hate the way you turned out to be (my name), such an ungrateful woman. Hope your money makes you happy and surround yourself with people that care about you. I am ashamed to tell my friends about you, you thinking I am jealous of you in the contrary I feel bad for you\u2026..the way you act towards your family\u2026. Scary\u2026 people just use you\u2026 your gay friends only hang out with you because you buy the alcohol and dinner\u2026. Yet you can\u2019t even invite your mother out to eat, it\u2019s so sad. Do not come here anymore, I\u2019m so disgusted with you. I really am so disgusted by you, makes me wonder what you did with your fat perv neighbor to make him so obsessed with you.. disgusting to think about. You hurt me when you were little and you hurt me now, best stay away from me. Fuck off, enjoy your greedy ass life and get that damn car out.\u201d\n\nSo yeah, that\u2019s the disrespect I needed to slap me back in to reality. She blows up a lot like this frequently. My friends and I always treat each other or split things when we go out, so I don\u2019t know where she got that fabricated lie from. Also, her remark about the pervy neighbor that would harass me is really despicable. ",

It also seems to take a day for the NSCC to realize a participant didn't pay their bills which is called the Date of Insolvency (\"DOI\").  \n\nSo, I made this table of dates for you (hope you like it!).\n\n[Dates, Dates, Dates!](https://preview.redd.it/wmozgk3owxdd1.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=6522b6dcd7444ca7ff2a789af413f532fabb16a7)\n\nEverything between the double horizontal lines at the bottom (days 36-38) are trading days whereas everything above that are calendar days.  You'll see weekends greyed out and the settlement date in light orange.\n\n**Notice something?**\n\nGME's Sneeze (2021) lines up exactly with the NSCC's settlement for RC's December 17-18, 2020 purchase, exactly as Lenarius posted.  Also, the May and June bumps line up exactly with T+35 and the NSCC Settlement consistent with the now deleted post about a [Cat Out Of The Bag](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dmdfmg/the_cat_is_out_of_the_bag_game_on/).  These two May and June periods were likely going to be huge spikes if GameStop didn't do their ATM Offerings.  (Which, btw, suggests the SEC may have nudged GameStop to help out with some share liquidity.  On the upside, GameStop now has $4B+ in the bank!) \n\n**For July, we may have the NSCC Settlement coming up** ***tomorrow*** **(July 22 and 23)** if the participant defaulted on the trade.  Or, maybe GameStop does another ATM Offering to help out with share liquidity and filling their coffers even more.  (Or maybe this is all wrong and/or we're in a completely fraudulent system.)\n\n# T35 + DOI + NSCC2\n\nPutting together the collective contributions of wrinkles means there are several trading deadlines in play regarding stock settlement.  First, T+1 or T+2 settlement.  If a stock trade isn't settled by the expected (now) T+1 Settlement date, then the trade is *supposed* to be settled by T+35 by the participant (e.g., short seller and/or market maker).  However, if the participant can't (or won't) settle on T+35, then the trade is declared insolvent (DOI: Date Of Insolvency) after which the NSCC takes over to settle the trade over 2 trading days.  \n\nThus, **T35 + DOI + NSCC2** which is calculated as C35 + T1 + T2.\n\n# Sources\n\n* [Rule 204(a)(2) for T35](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/242.204)\n* [NSCC Disclosure Framework for DOI + NSCC2](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/policy-and-compliance/NSCC_Disclosure_Framework.pdf)\n* [The Cat is Out of The Bag - Game On](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dmdfmg/the_cat_is_out_of_the_bag_game_on/)",

Well this is just the average price of each share sold if they just have to buy 304m shares.\n\nI busted out an old dd about Geometric Mean and they concluded that at GME reaching $100m ($25m post split) the DTCC would only have to pay out $9.T, which is an average price of ~$114k. This is about 20% of the total that I calculated above which is insane to think about.\n https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/s/Oue1MmJF4V\n\nNow what about all the other costs associated with the above points? Inflation since? Opportunity costs of them shutting on the buy button?

            "body": "I have a previous post on this but since this is my FINAL one, I'll include everything here. \n\n\n\n**Disclaimer -** All you anti-T35 shills can gtfo off this post and talk about how your regarded swap basket expiration will cause the MOASS for the 100th time in the past 4 years or how buying K0SS will blow up an ETF and cause MOASS. While the theory I am presenting is being tested right now, it has been holding up very well so far. This is by far the most plausible way Roaring Kitty is able to have racked up so much cash while knowing when stock moves are going to happen. I will not abandon it until I see if fail by the end of next week. This is not me trying to be cocky or arrogant, I just think this is by far the most plausible theory by a mile on this subreddit and it seems to be rarely discussed.\n\n  \n**What is the theory?**\n\nThe theory being put to test right now is to see if the market maker algorithms are exploiting T+35 settlement in order to distribute buying pressure in their liking throughout a 35 day period. According to this theory, if a large purchase was concentrated in a small window, the market makers will abuse FTDs so they can distribute that buying pressure out in a 35 day period before a forced buyback. It makes absolute sense for market makers to strategically FTD because it allows these robots to have more control over price because they can turn the hose of buying pressure on and off within this cycle to form whatever trading patterns they want. Credit to Biggy for giving me the foundation to build upon this.\n\n\n\n**How Am I Testing This Theory?**\n\nWell we would need someone to purchase a large amount of shares in a short period of time. Then we would have to see how price reacts. Then we would repeat the same test again and see if the chart looks similar. Only if we can get two large similar buys and compare the charts. \n\n\n\nOh wait, we already have that? You're telling me that Roaring Kitty and Ryan Cohen purchase nearly identical amounts of GME shares on different dates? \n\n  \n*YES*\n\n\n\nOn December 17th and 18th of 2020, Ryan Cohen bought NEARLY 4 million shares (3.81 million) of GME (adjusted for split).\n\n[Ryan Cohen Buy](https://preview.redd.it/gwheeonpc0cd1.png?width=1237&format=png&auto=webp&s=c92e5f135c31071b86e89bbc61d2e69f971a9d70)\n\n\n\nHere is the 35 day cycle\n\n[RC Settlement Cycle](https://preview.redd.it/ovnecjrpd0cd1.png?width=1427&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c4ab40be08e2cdfb289f615747108c139ee8688)\n\n\n\nOn June 11th or 12th, Roaring Kitty purchase 4 million shares of GME. Here is the 35 day cycle in comparison.\n\n[RK Settlement Cycle](https://preview.redd.it/kh02do13e0cd1.png?width=1351&format=png&auto=webp&s=7eb3da97fb61f4441e26e8dbfb20ea657b79086f)\n\n  \n**Why am I looking at fractals?**\n\nThe math being used to run out buying pressure in these algorithms is the same. This means that the structures you are looking at are going to look similar. The difference between this fractal analysis and other fractal analysis is that this fractal analysis has an objective reference frame which is a purchase date and a settlement day. It's bounded within it. \n\n  \nFor those who are new to fractals, fractals aren't copy and paste. There just has to be a similar structure presented in which I and others I discuss with think is undeniable. \n\n  \n**Confirmation Bias** \n\nIt is speculated that Roaring Kitty bought $30 calls for next week (7/19). This makes sense because this is what Roaring Kitty is playing off of. He's abusing the settlement cycles. \n\n  \n**I want to get to bed**\n\nSorry for half-assing this post, I wanted to just get this out there so people will understand why the proceeding price action happens, I don't feel like adding more detail to this because I'm tired. I just want to add that nothing is guaranteed. I have conviction in what I have been following and it could be wrong. But until it's wrong, it's right. And so far, it's not wrong. Also want to add in my last post, I tried to speed up the fractal to my liking and I falsely assumed the gold box happened. It's clear now that it happened today and may continue into Friday or maybe not.\n\n  \n",

During months the Starlight settlement has been suffering from radiation poisoning, so I decided to isolate the radioactive crater at the centre.\n\nI started by putting a wired fence around it. To do that, I was constantly exposing myself to high-level radiation, going in and out of \"the zone\" just to place the fence in such a way that not so much space gets lost.\n\nAfter a huge amount of wood and steel, and a humongous amount of time, I declared \"the zone\" isolated.\n\nGood. Problem solved. Right? Right? Well, after my first visit a few days later, I found settlers trapped inside the wired fence. We decided to put a gate, just to let them out. Even someone suggested putting a warning sign at the entrance, just to avoid accidents for newcomers.\n\nBut that wasn't enough. It was clear that we needed the space once the settlement got enough people without a bed. So we faced a struggling voting process to determine where to put the wood house that would hold the beds. There was no other choice: we would build the house on top of the crater and deal with the radiation consequences.\n\nTo convince ourselves that we were doing the right thing, we considered that if the beds were put high enough, it would be sufficient distance from the barrels. Unfortunately, the only settler that had architecture knowledge provided the blueprints. I inspected the design only to find out that there wasn't enough space to fit all the beds on the second floor. I didn't have the guts to tell the rest; I thought I would figure it out someway later. So, the construction began.\n\nThe workers involved, including myself, got really sick after the first hours because we started with the base situated right on top of the crater and the barrels. After reaching the second floor, we noticed the rads were decreasing. But here's the catch: only around forty percent of the second floor was usable, and half of that portion was still highly irradiated. Then, all the rest of the workers acknowledged the truth: this isn't going to work.\n\nI went down after trying to fit several sleeping bags in a small corner (and failed). Don't know if it was the exhausted state of my mind, or the speed and careless work put into the base building, but suddenly I found myself trapped below the house by a small hole that wouldn't let me get out.\n\nSo there I was, trapped in a small nuclear-inundated crater, surrounded by radioactive barrels frying my skin and ghoulifying me in a matter of seconds, without any possible escape, swirling in circles awaiting the inevitable outcome of this tragic plan.\n\nI dropped any hope when I looked at my Pip-Boy and the stats showed how bad things really were. I closed my fist in anger and dropped a faithful hit to one of my executors, one of those damn barrels, and then... then I realised: if I was going to die, I would bring them with me. I started punching them with all my strength, but only got an infuriating metal sound as return. That's it. This is the end.\n\nI can't remember how it happened, it may be the radiation messing with my synapses... I don't know, all I know is that suddenly a spark in my brain triggered a thought: \"If you can't beat them, scrap 'em\".\n\nIt was today's date that I learned we can scrap radiation barrels and make all the radiation go away.\n\nI scrapped them all and waited for my coworkers to open a hole to rescue me.\n\n",

            "body": "With the recent talk of Todger divorce again, I wanted to re-visit some older stories in which the RF appears to have been threatened for years with up to a **$100 million** divorce settlement.\n\nFamilies don't pay divorce settlements, only the spouse and their income is taken into account. Why would the RF pay That One a settlement, unless it's under duress?\n\n**May 19, 2018** - An [article](https://archive.is/wip/U3RIH) published the day of the Todger wedding was already discussing the \"what-ifs\" in a Todger divorce and how much money That One would get from the BRF. The article discussed royal prenups:\n\n* that \"*all*\u00a0of the couple\u2019s wealth gets divvied up, not just what each spouse brought into a marriage\". This certainly sounds threatening.\n* that Diana received a **$23 million** settlement from Charles, alluding to That One being worth much more with inflation.\n\nIt seems strange divorce was discussed the day of the wedding unless it is the idea That One had all along.\n\n[**January 28, 2019**](https://archive.is/JSugs), the palace is allegedly already in \"crisis talks\" over the marriage with a **$37 million** settlement discussed. We now know the RF and staff were abused in the lead-up to the marriage: Charlotte's dress fitting, \"We both know I'll be your boss soon,\" employees \"slumped over their desks\", etc.\n\n[**March 3, 2019**](https://archive.is/vy06Y)**,** shortly after the obscene New York \"baby\" shower, threats appear of a **$25 million** settlement to pay off That One with New York property. That One allegedly:\n\n* was using the guise of a baby shower to \"scout apartments on the Upper East Side.\" She \"fell instantly in love with\" a\u00a0$25.4 million apartment.\n* can't afford it but would no doubt \"get a huge payout given she\u2019s the mother of \\[This One\\]'s child.\"\n* \"as a royal divorcee, the commercial opportunities... would make her millions and millions.\" \\[This old chestnut again.\\]\n* conceived a scheme to have Amal or Serena buy the apartment and keep it for when That One can \"buy them out\" \\[LOL\\]\n* may use Amal as her divorce lawyer \\[LOL\\]\n\n[**February 14, 2020**](https://archive.is/wip/9q3Bh), a blind after Megxit states that stories about their brand valuation amount is really That One's \"buyout number,\" a.k.a. the amount it will take her to \"go away\" and be less of a p.i.t.a. [News](https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6125033619001) (unarchived) stories in January were predicting Brand Todger \"could get up to **$100 million\"** to $1 billion. The RF didn't bite, so the Todgers trashed the family in the media.\n\n[**January 16, 2023**](https://archive.is/pdtVd), King Charles reportedly \"could\" pay That One a generous settlement to get rid of her and \"save his son\" (too late for that, IMO.) This time we are up to **$50 million**. The settlement will also include child support for the invisikids.\n\n[**July 3, 2023**](https://archive.is/wip/7nQAQ), the **$80 million** figure was allegedly part of the pre-nup to take care of any alleged children. This One was allegedly pre-contracted for full custody, yet That One was pre-contracted to \"receive\u00a0$80 million\u00a0for their support\" that she will \"fight\" for. Why That One would receive $80 million to support children who are in This One's full custody is illogical.\n\nIt is interesting now that we know the bullying the RF was put under, it seems the bullying was a means to get them to pay her off to go away. They didn't fall for it or any of her other schemes. This results in Montecito-sourced harassment about reconciliation, olive branches and sweet nods that makes the one-sided bullying seem like a 50/50 spat.\n\nNow This One is cut off from his family and there is no way That One will get $23 or $100 million from the RF. That One can make her threats for an imaginary settlement as the RF continues to gray rock.",

You can not move enough to be useful. Swifties will be a troll-tier item now and I really don't know what the point of this change is. Yeah they're too strong on ranged champions but this removes the item from melee champions too. Maybe just reduce the MS it gives instead of removing the item from the game?\n\nRylais essentially deletes certain champions from teamfights and swifties somewhat alleviates this. Asol, zyra, brand all use the item disgustingly well to a point that even ranged champions are crippled if they get hit by a stray projectile. Not only that but Riot keeps buffing slows on champions. Perhaps with the removal of swifties they're planning to reduce slow creep? -copium\n\nRiot keeps mentioning how something **feels** bad to play. Well, you know what **feels** really bad to play? Playing vs slow-heavy teams on a melee champion lacking mobility and not being able to itemize slow resistance. You're a walking sack of gold that relies on flash cooldown to do anything at all.",

Initially I wanted to romance Shadowheart, mostly because how popular she is on the internet. Everyone is cosplaying as her everywhere. Hell, Karlach isn't even on the main splash screen. It's the other five companions and Mizora.\n\nBut once I met Karlach; from the very first few dialogues, I was like... \"Shadowheart who?\"\n\nEven though her ending wasn't exactly conclusive and I hope to see a dlc to wrap it up; I didn't regret not going for SH even once.\n\nI did my second run on Tactician, Dark Urge full evil style. Oh man did I miss Karlach. I romanced Minthara this time. It was very lackluster. Also you miss so much content going evil and also miss out some great items from missing vendors.\n\nNow I have started my third run on Honour mode, going the Good Guy path again as I was a total noob on my first run and missed a lot of stuff. This time, I decided from the beginning that I'll do the Shadowheart romance path. But my God it is hard to resist Karlach when she says, \"Really? Really really?\"\n\nShe's just a sweetheart. Am I the only one who likes Karlach this much over SH?",

I was relieved Cyrus and Zee made up and understand the enormity of that moment in Cyrus's life, but couldn't the moment have just stood for itself? \n\nAlso, I enjoyed the shifting perspective throughout the novel and appreciated that it gave us insight into each character (especially Roya) which we would have missed out on if we'd just been limited to Cyrus's POV, but thought ending with the perspective of the art gallerist/Roya's ex wife (apologies for forgetting her name. I already returned the audiobook on Libby and can't find it online) since she was not really a key character.

He is struggling to find his purpose in life, but more importantly is concerned with having a life worth remembering. His mother was in a passenger plane that was shot down by the U.S military as it was mistaken as a threat. (This was real, 290 people dead). This fuels his need to have a life remembered after death, as his mother did not die a martyr, she died for no reason. \n\nHe is a poet, and decides to write a book on martyrs and martyrdom. I don\u2019t want to give too much else away. It\u2019s beautifully written and takes multiple different POVs at times, in a refreshing way. \n\nIt is hilarious, dark/heavy, heartbreaking and uplifting all at once. \n\nHere are some of my favorite kindle highlights to give you a sense of the authors style and the books vibe (no spoilers, I promise):\n\n\u201cExpendable\u201d may seem a bad word to use to describe your own life, except I actually find it liberating.

So each morning you said yes, then stepped into the consequence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen people think about traveling to the past, they do it with this wild sense of self-importance. Like, \u2018gosh, I better not step on that flower or my grandfather will never be born.\u2019 But in the present we mow our lawns and poison ants and skip parties and miss birthdays all the time. We never think about the effects of that stuff.\u201d Roya was working herself up. \u201cNobody thinks of now as the future past.\u201d",

Basically every parent that works is still helping their kids with hw and taking them to activities. You don't need to be a SAHM to do that\n\n\n\nMy sister and her husband have two kids. They are both in school. This whole year she has been complaining  constantly about how hard it is to be a stay at home mom but she doesn't want to go back to work. Even though her husband has been pushing her to do for a while.\n\nThe issue is that she doesn't do much compared to her husband. He takes the kids to school in the morning. The kids have come home on the bus in the afternoon. She has a whole day with no kids that she can do whatever she wants. Maintaining the house is like 2 hours a day. That leaves her with abut 6-7 hours of just being there. I was a stay at home parent after I lost my old job for a bit, really it's not that hard when the kids are in school almost all day.\n\nAnyways, she came over yesterday and was ranting. They got into a argument about her picking up more slack or getting a job. I guess this started because he came home to a dirty house and no groceries in the fridge. I asked why she wasn't doing chores or at least getting food and she told me she didn't have time.\n\nI asked if she got a work job and it was a no. I asked what she is doing all day and gave me no answer. She then went on a rant about how he isn't doing enough and her husband is being unfair.\n\nAt this point I had enough, I told her she isn't a martyr to be a stay at home mom. That she literally gets everything paid for and can't even both to get food. I told her if I was her husband I would divorce her since she acts more like a kid than a partner\n\nThis started our own argument and she is pissed. I personally thinks she needed to here it \n\n\n\n",

Now, this coworkers grew up with wealthy parents who were both physicians and had a live-in nanny. Also, he\u2019s a man and doesn\u2019t have to endure pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding and will no doubt push off the majority of childrearing on to his wife. He kept going on about how parents do anything to make their kid happy (no, not all parents \ud83d\ude43) from vacations to schooling, to activities. Then I challenged him and said, what if your child was transgendered and wanted to live their life the opposite of \u201chow you raised them.\u201d Could you be happy for your child then? He got real quiet. I went on and mentioned how many parents (most religious) will abandon their kids, send them to conversion therapy, disown them etc. Why couldn\u2019t they be happy for their child? If being transgender made them happy, why couldn\u2019t they support them? At that point, he got up and walked out. Breeders need to get their heads out of their asses and STFU! End rant. ",

What\u2019s the deal with these martyrs? Nobody is too busy to take a ten minute walk. And even if they aren\u2019t, who takes it upon themselves to chime in like that? Ok boomer \ud83d\ude02 anyone else have similar stories?\n\nEdit: First off, y\u2019all are hilarious. Would love to have some of you as my coworkers. For more context, yes, he did just walk in and then walk out. Like some annoying phantom. Next, yes, this is a government setting, so it has attracted people who settle into busy work. His project is the same every year and is the definition of busy work. Never smiles, always walks past me with no glance, and the people that work under him say that he LOATHES when they work remotely, even though they have that option. He makes sure they are always on green and breathes down their necks. It is all so unnecessary. Thanks for affirming that you all feel the same \ud83d\ude02 ",

Imagine you're forced to live in poverty because your neighboring country doesn't think you're good enough to be truly independent.\n\nOne last note: I'm agnostic, but I'll nonetheless pray for the Palestinian civilians who've been oppressed and caught in the crossfire for decades.

            "body": "First a disclaimer. We are not discussing morality of rocket attacks on Israel. I think that they are a deeply immoral and I will never change my mind about that. We are here to discuss the stupidity of such attacks, which should dissuade even the most evil terrorist from engaging in them (if they had a bit of self-respect). \n\nSo with that cleared up, we can start. Since cca. 2006, rocket attacks on Israel became almost a daily occurence with just few short pauses. Hamas and to a lesser extent Hezbollah would fire quite primitive missiles towards Israel with a very high frequency. While the exact number of the rockets fired is impossible to count, we know that we are talking about high tens of thousands.\n\nOn the very beginning, the rockets were to a point succesful as a terror measure and they caused some casualties. However, Israel quickly adapted to this tactic. The combination of the Iron Dome system with the Red Color early-warning radars and extensive net of bomb shelters now protects Israeli citizens extremely well. \n\nSure, Israeli air defence is costly. But not prohibitively costly. The Tamir interceptor for the Iron Dome comes at a price between 20k and 50k dollars (internet sources can't agree on this one). The financial losses caused by the attacks are relatively negligible in comparison to the total Israeli military budget. \n\nThe rocket attacks have absolutely massive downsides for Palestine though. Firstly, they really discredit the Palestinian cause for independence in the eyes of foreign observers. It is very difficult to paint constant terrorist missile attacks as a path to peace, no matter how inefficient they are. \n\nSecondly, they justify Israeli strikes within Gaza and South Lebanon which lead to both Hamas/Hezbollah losses and unfortunately also civilian casualties. How can you blame the Isralies when they are literally taking out launch sites which fire at their country, though?  \n\nThirdly, the rocket attacks justify the Israeli blockade of Gaza. It is not hard to see that Israeli civilians would be in great peril if Hamas laid their hands on more effective weapons from e.g. Iran. Therefore, the blockade seems like a very necessary measure. \n\nFourth problem is that the rocket production consumes valuable resources like the famous dug-up water piping. No matter whether the EU-funded water pipes were operational or not (that seems to be a source of a dispute), the fragile Palestinian economy would surely find better use for them than to send them flying high at Israel in the most inefficient terrorist attack ever. \n\nThere is a fifth issue. Many of the rockets malfunction and actually fall in Palestinian territories. This figures can be as high as tens of percents. It is quite safe to say that Hamas is much more succesful at bombing Palestine than Israel. \n\nYet, the missile strikes have very high levels of support in the Palestinian population. We do not have recent polls and the numbers vary, but incidental datapoints suggest that high tens of percents of Palestinians support them (80 percent support for the missile attacks (2014) or 40 percent (2013) according to wiki). I absolutely don't understand this, because to me the rockets seem so dumb that it should discourage even the worst terrorist from using them. \n\nTo change my view about sheer stupidity of these terror strikes, I would have to see some real negative effect which they have on Israel or positive effect which they have on Palestine.

Access to the northern areas along the coast remain more limited at up to 6 NM, well below the 20 NM agreed under the Oslo Accords (see map).\n\nDespite the improved access, the situation remains unpredictable: between April and October 2019, the fishing limits have been changed (i.e. reduced or extended) 14 times, including on three occasions when Israel announced a full naval closure that denied Palestinian fishers access to the sea following the launching of incendiary balloons towards Israel.\n\nThere is a direct correlation between the scope of access to the sea and the quantity and value of the fishing catch; the further out to sea fishers can go, the deeper the water and the higher the value of the fish caught (see chart 1).

            "body": "\\>!DISCLAIMER: This post is only a conversation with the decent people left within our society who just want peace.!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the Prime minster of israel, and the rest of his extremist cabinet, just want the war to rage on, as long as they get their paychecks, and as long as the people they dislike are dying. Doesn't matter if it's at the cost of kids, elderly, pregnant women, hostages.. They just pretend to have a mission.\n\nSo let's talk about the supposed mission of \"Eliminating Hamas\"\n\nThe israeli gov will claim they are only targeting Hamas..\n\nBut, for years, Netanyahu was reported to be helping fund Hamas (as per [TimesOfIsrael](https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/) & [NyTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/10/world/middleeast/israel-qatar-money-prop-up-hamas.html)), and in 2019, He himself said and i [quote](https://twitter.com/haaretzcom/status/1711329340804186619?lang=en); \"Whoever wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state needs to support the strengthening and financing of Hamas.\n\n\"On top of that, The current finance minister of israel, said in 2015 and i [quote](https://twitter.com/rulajebreal/status/1720923597873549554) \"Hamas at this point, in my opinion, is an asset.\"\n\nSo how can you eliminate your asset?\n\nHere's the government strategy;\n\nKeep Hamas in power. Offer anything except a sovereign Palestinian state \"for security reasons\", and disrupt any real effort for Peace ([Osslo accords](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/12/oslo-israel-reneged-colonial-palestine)). Ignore the illegal settlements ([condemned by the UN](https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15424.doc.htm)), and the killing of Palestinians in the israeli controlled West bank.\n\nMake life unbearable for Palestinians, Facilitate unemployment [conditions](https://www.btselem.org/gaza_strip/20190606_forced_unemployment), cut the water sources ([documented](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2017/11/the-occupation-of-water/)), introduce bills to control the [courts](https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-s-supreme-court-overturns-a-key-component-of-netanyahu-s-polarizing-judicial-overhaul-/7420408.html), destroying the biggest buildings in Gaza to displace civilians, killing and arresting civilians who protest or show any contempt of past actions, Hamas attacks you, literally do whatever you want (Defending yourself).\n\n5 months after Oct the 7th, Gaza flattened, at least 30k civilians dead (most are women and children as reported by the pentagon), israel killed more hostages than released, Hamas still around.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe goal was clear, even before Oct the 7th, they never wanted Peace, or a Palestinian state.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2023 was reported to be the deadliest year in the history of the West bank. It got to the point where Biden himself had put a ban on individuals committing atrocities there, and that's not mentioning the uncontrolled army killings, because they see no consequences, they act as if the Palestinian lives do not matter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs cited in South Africa's [case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOW_1exsHE8), the army led by Netanyahu believe everyone in Gaza is complicit, as Netanyahu cited the biblical term \"Amalek\" at the beginning of the offensive on Gaza, he said \"Remember what the Amalek has done to you.\"\n\nThe biblical scripture regarding Amalekites reads \"I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel. Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.\n\n'The IDF soldiers later filmed themselves shouting \"There are no innocent civilians\". They also have filmed themselves celebrating destruction, burning aid, looting homes, posing in women's underwear, mocking traumatized people, the list goes on..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently, famine is looming on many in Gaza, as reports confirm israel have been blocking aid to the entire north, for three month, till two days ago, when they got pressured into letting 13 trucks in, which is way short of what is needed (500 trucks per day as estimated by UN).\n\nEarlier this week, The US Senator Chris Van Hollen admits after crafting the national security memorandum, and after the reports, that israel is not in compliance with international law, they are blocking aid such as maternity kits, water purifiers, from entering the Gaza strip, sending back a lot of the of trucks, not to mention letting civilians block aid entrances..\n\nHe also stated that, \u201cThere is no doubt that the claims that Netanyahu made that UNRWA is a tool of Hamas are \"flat-out lies,\",\" The person who runs operations on the ground in Gaza is a 20 year U.S. Army veteran\u201d, he added.\n\nEarlier, The israeli gov claimed 12 UNRWA (Aid agency) members were affiliated with Hamas, without providing evidence, and the US cut aid to UNRWA, so did the EU, amidst famine. Now amidst investigations, there is no evidence of such affiliation, even UNRWA stated that personal were tortured to admit such links. The EU have restored funding, and the US is still pending..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt has become evident that the Netanyahu's government, and those with extremist ideology (Zionism), never wanted peace in the middle east (as stated in the Likud party charter) they want all the land from Jordan to the sea, and they will abuse the power given to them without oversight\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs history shows, if we really want to achieve peace, we must deliver justice, prosecute criminals, and figure out democratic solutions, without malicious intent from fascist governments.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd before you go,Here are my 3 main questions/concerns to be answered thoroughly for you to change my mind;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1-  Why would the israeli army [bulldoze](https://twitter.com/i/status/1748013404663537974) trees in the middle of the roads, render all water treatment plants nonfunctional or [destroyed](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/17/world/middleeast/gaza-water-plant-photos.html), blocking aid trucks from entering maternity kits & water purifiers?\n\n2- According to all humanitarian fronts ([UN](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/03/1147656), [IRC](https://www.rescue.org/press-release/famine-imminent-northern-gaza-children-are-being-starved-israels-blockade-and), [ICP](https://www.care-international.org/news/ipc-report-half-gaza-experiencing-catastrophic-hunger-famine-imminent-northern-governorates) and more), 1 million civilians in Gaza right now are facing stage 5 of famine (the highest), why would the israeli gov still blockade the aid when they can control how it is distributed and got the armed forces to secure that?\n\n3- Some people are yelling \"release the hostages\" on posts of dying kids (as if these kids got them), do you think it's acceptable for the isreali gov to starve kids/innocent civilians to death if Hamas can sort themselves out and not surrender?",

I am not going to pretend that my 400-word post here can do it justice, and I'll preface by saying that anything I post here is, out of necessity, going to have to be gross oversimplification:\n\n The Israelis frequently condemn the Palestinian side (such as the current ongoing Hamas attack) for terrorist attacks and whatnot - unsurprisingly so, given that Israel is their side (just like how America, of course, condemned the 9/11 attacks.) **But I am not convinced that, if the roles were reversed, that the Israelis would be behaving any differently.**\n\nSay that Israel were squelched and prevented from being a formally-recognized nation state on terms that it wanted (yes, the Palestinians have been offered two-state solutions, but none that they found satisfactory), and also that it was facing continuous blockade, in poverty, were under the control of a much bigger, stronger, richer opponent of the opposing religion, and that this went on for decades with no end in sight. \n\nI don't believe, for one moment, that the Israelis would say \"Well, we'll just be content and stay like this forever and always pursue peaceful solutions even though we've found that peace gets us nothing.\" The Israelis would be doing something just like what Gaza Hamas is doing right now. **And in fact, that's similar to what Israel did, in fact, do. The Lehi (Stern Gang) used terrorist attacks to help get the nation of Israel formed in the first place, back in the 1940s.**\n\nSo the viewpoint I am trying to get changed is this: If the Israelis were in the shoes of the Palestinians, they'd behave the same. And in fact, most people in the world would, too.",

The suffering on both sides is appalling, and a ceasefire should have happened ages ago. Frankly, the people responsible for war crimes on either side need to be held accountable under international law. There\u2019s no excuse for allowing this violence to continue unchecked.\n\nNow, about this idea of a one-state solution seriously? It\u2019s hard to picture two groups who\u2019ve been at each other\u2019s throats for decades suddenly living together in one happy state. The level of hatred and mistrust between Israelis and Palestinians isn\u2019t something that just disappears because someone draws new borders. Trying to force them into a single state feels like a recipe for disaster.\n\nThe demographics alone would be a nightmare. Depending on the immigration, one group is bound to end up with more power than the other. Whether it\u2019s Jews or Arabs, one side will inevitably dominate politically, economically, and socially, which is just going to fuel even more resentment. And honestly, the last thing this conflict needs is more reasons for people to feel oppressed or sidelined.\n\nIn the end, a one-state solution seems like one of the worst ideas out there. The violence wouldn\u2019t magically go away. In fact, it would probably get worse. Both sides have lost too much, and there\u2019s way too much bad blood to think that merging them into a single state would work. Any real solution has to acknowledge their differences and deal with the core issues, not just mash them together and hope for the best",

I donate to a variety of causes whenever I have the extra money, and sometimes it can be really difficult to assess which cause needs your money more. Due to this, I absolutely understand how innocent people get caught up in EA in a desire to do the maximum amount of good for the world. However, EA as an organization is incredibly shady. u/Evinceo provided this great article: https://www.truthdig.com/articles/effective-altruism-is-a-welter-of-fraud-lies-exploitation-and-eugenic-fantasies/*\n\nBig figures like [Sam Bankman-Fried and Elon Musk](https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilywashburn/2023/03/08/what-to-know-about-effective-altruism-championed-by-musk-bankman-fried-and-silicon-valley-giants/) consider themselves \"effective altruists.\" From the [Effective Altruism site](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) itself, *\"Everyone wants to do good, but many ways of doing good are ineffective. The EA community is focused on finding ways of doing good that actually work.\"* For clarification, not all Effective Altruists are bad people, and some of them do donate to charity and are dedicated to helping people, which is always good.

Hamas by itself is generally bad, all warcrimes are a big no-no, but isreal has a literal documented history of warcrimes, so trying to play a both sides approach when one of them is clearly an oppressor and the other is a resistance is quite morally bankrupt. By the same logic(which requires the ignorance of isreals bloodied history as an oppressive colonizer), you would still consider Nelson Mandela as a terrorist for his methods ending the apartheid in South Africa the same way the rest of the world did up until relatively recently.](https://old.reddit.com/r/EffectiveAltruism/comments/1bkjhbq/most_effective_aid_to_gaza/kw5xbh0/)\n\n> Response: Do you have any footage of Nelson Mandela parachuting down and shooting up a concert?\n\n\n>[The variance and uncertainty is much higher. This is always true for emergency interventions but especially so given Hamas\u2019 record for pilfering aid.

From the stats I saw a few weeks ago Gaza is receiving nearly 2 times more money per capita in aid than any other nation\u2026 it\u2019s definitely not a money issue at this point.\n\n> Responding to above poster: But where is the money going?\n\n> Responding to above poster: Hamas heads are billionaires living decadently in qatar\n\n\n>[I\u2019m not sure if the specific price of inputs are the whole scope of what constitutes an effective effort.

It\u2019s definitely not neglected compared to causes like lead poisoning or say vitamin b(3?) deficiency. It\u2019s tractability is probably contingent on things outside our individual or even group collective agency. It\u2019s scale/impact i\u2019m not sure about the numbers to be honest. I just saw a post of a guy holding his hand of his daughter trapped under an earthquake who died. This same sentiment feels similar, something awful to witness, but with the extreme added bitterness of malevolence. So it makes sense that empathetically minded people would be sickened and compelled to action. However, I think unless you have some comparative advantage in your ability to influence this situation, it\u2019s likely net most effective to aim towards other areas.

So they expect to come out of this in a better position than at the start of the war.\n\nThis deal does NOT imply an end to the decades-long conflict, just a \"long lasting ceasefire\". There is no recognition of Israel as a state and no commitment to normalizing relations. If Israel accepted this, how long do you think it would be before the next rocket attack/suicide bombing/rape and murder spree?\n\nBut Israel gets their hostages back right?\n\n>If there are fewer than 33 living Israeli detainees to be released, a number of bodies from the same categories shall be released to complete this stage.

            "body": "1. For 17 years, the people of Gaza have lived under an illegal blockade. Half of the population are children. Over 90 percent of the drinking water is contaminated. Over half the population are unemployed. Over half the population are considered refugees. Most are descendants of refugees who fled during the Nakba - Israel's ethnic cleansing of Palestine.\n\n2. Over the course of years Israel has refused offers of a truce in exchange for lifting the blockade, which is an illegal form of collective punishment under international law. David Cameron, when he was prime minister of the UK, said the blockade had turned Gaza into \"a prison camp\".  Netanyahu himself has killed peace deals and is accused of killing the previous prime minister for accepting the Oslo accords. \n\n3. Last week, Hamas broke out of the world's largest concentration camp and launched an attack on Israel. There are reports of a massacre at a rave, Israel reports innocents were murdered. Video evidence shows people running and a shootout between security and Hamas. \n\n4. There is still no evidence of the claim of 40 beheaded babies. The original source for the 40 beheaded babies claim was a radical settler who has advocated genocide of Palestinians. We have been given an alleged picture of the charred remains of a baby by the Israeli government. Twitter fact-checking has called this images an AI generated fake. If real, We do not know how or where this baby died. Stories of atrocities were reported on uncritically by the mainstream media across the West.  \n\n5. Israel's defense minister said they were fighting \"human animals\" and cut off all water, electricity, fuel and food into Gaza. At the same time, Netanyahu told the Israeli people to prepare for a long war, meaning Israel intends to starve Gaza's civilian population of essential supplies for a long time. Collective punishment is a war crime.  \n\n6. Norman Finkelstein, the world's foremost expert on the Israel/Palestine conflict, said he believes the denial of food and water to Gaza, and the promise of a long war, constitutes the beginning of a genocide against the people of Gaza.\n\n7. An elected member of the Israeli ruling party called for a \"second Nakba\" on the Palestinians. Another member of the Israeli Knesset said there are \"no innocents in Gaza\", and advocated \"flattening\" it. The Israeli President said tonight that there are no innocent civilians in Gaza: \"It's an entire nation out there that is responsible\".\n\n8. Israel killed hundreds of civilians in a terror bombing campaign and dropped outlawed white phosphorus on the densely populated Gaza strip. Medics in Gaza say ambulances and health facilities have been targeted by IDF missiles.\n\n9. After 6 days of bombardment, over 300 thousand people had been left homeless, and over 1,500 Palestinians dead. As of the latest reports, about 700 children have been killed.\n\n10. Last night, Israel gave over 1 million people a days notice to evacuate half of Gaza, intending to flatten the area in a ground invasion. There is credible video evidence that Israel did not respect it's commitment to avoid bombing the main roads used for evacuation, and bombed a truck carrying dozens of civilians.\n\n11. Tonight, Israel announced it would cut off the internet from Gaza, meaning the horrors it is about to enact on the population will be hidden from the world.  \n\nThese are facts. If you state them, you will be accused of defending terrorism, or being antisemitic, but they are the facts. \n\nWhen talk of collective punishment, ethnic cleansing, and outright genocide are being normalised among supposedly respected voices, we should be very skeptical of narratives being presented to us by the same people.",

Peace is what we\u2019re fighting for\u201d and \u201cEnd the genocide.\u201d \n\nSince November, MU student groups have held weekly demonstrations to protest the thousands of civilians killed and injured in Gaza from Israeli attacks, which were launched after Hamas terrorists killed 1,200 Israeli citizens and captured hundreds. Monday\u2019s protest was the biggest by far.\n\nThe demonstration was organized by a coalition of five student organizations. The 90-minute protest ended with speeches by a few of the organizers.\n\n\u201dAs students, we learn about history in the hopes that we can make sure that it doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but we also need to acknowledge that student activism is an integral part of American history,\u201d said Lima Sherzad, president of Mizzou Muslim Students\u2019 Organization. \u201cAnd change did not come easy; speaking out against injustices was not easy. Yet the students showed up time and time again. And there is where we need to draw our energy and momentum from. Each of us have a responsibility towards the people of Gaza and Palestinian to raise our voices and protest this brutal onslaught.\u201d\n\nIan De Smet, co-chair of the Mizzou Young Democratic Socialists of America, stressed the power of gathering for a common effort. He urged students to stay active in local efforts as summer begins and students return home.\n\n\u201cThose bombs dropping on Gaza, they have the seal of the United States government, and we, as citizens, have the responsibility and the power to stand up,\u201d De Smet said.\n\nOrganizers scheduled Monday\u2019s demonstration on a weekday and encouraged students to walk out of class to participate, compared to the weekly protests on Saturdays.\n\nProtests have proliferated across U.S. universities, including high-profile events at Columbia University, Yale University, the University of Texas at Austin, Emory University and the University of Southern California. Tensions have risen, and some of these demonstrations have been met with police action, arrests and student suspensions. On Monday afternoon, police arrested more than 100 protestors at Washington University in St. Louis. Local protest organizers said they wanted to ensure that Monday\u2019s demonstration was peaceful.\n\nMizzou Students for Justice in Palestine has helped organize Columbia\u2019s weekly protests and plan Monday\u2019s walkout.\n\nMSJP worked with university officials to ensure the protest remained peaceful. MU spokesperson Christian Basi said administrators and organizers talked through logistics, such as specifying the route the march took and ensuring that marchers stayed on sidewalks to maintain a safe event.\n\nSuch protests highlight a difficult challenge for colleges: they need to be places where students can freely share ideas while also keeping everyone safe.\n\nAfter the MU campus was roiled in 2015 by student protests of racial acts and insensitivity, the university modified some policies concerning protests and created new policies, such as a policy requiring permits for sound amplification.\n\nBut more than just creating policies, Basi said, \u201cwe were adamant about changing our interactions with student groups. That was very much on display today,\u201d he said. The university has \u201chad very positive conversations with student groups.\n\n\u201cWhile the university does not endorse a particular viewpoint of anyone on the campus or any student group, by being in contact with us, we were able to make sure that they were aware of all of our policies as well as our procedures and provide them with some information to ensure their event could go off smoothly and without a hitch,\u201d Basi said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what happened today.\u201d\n\nMSJP\u2019s Isleen Atallah said the conflict in Gaza is a local issue. \u201cThe situation in Palestine is not just a distant conflict; it\u2019s a humanitarian crisis that demands global attention,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are here to remind our community and the world that peace is possible, but it requires action from all of us.\u201d\n\nMU junior Sanya Suri said she came to Monday\u2019s walkout to speak out on behalf of the innocent people in Palestine. \u201cEveryone deserves peace. Everyone deserves their own land. Everyone deserves access to food, water, and education,\u201d Suri said. \u201cEveryone honestly just deserves to be treated like a human being, and that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening right now,\u201d Suri said she tries to attend the Saturday protests when she can as well.\n\nMichael Volz, faculty advisor for MSJP, said he was glad students had the freedom to express their concerns about what is happening in Gaza.\n\n\u201cSpeaking for myself and not the university, my hope is that people who come here will continue to write to their political leaders and to speak out in the hopes that we hold the U.S. government accountable,\u201d said Volz, an associate professor of Chinese and director of MU\u2019s International Studies Program.\n\nThe conflict escalated following an attack by Hamas on October 7, 2023, which killed at least 1,200 people in Israel, according to CNN. That prompted intense military attacks by Israel across Gaza, affecting hospitals, residential areas, and critical infrastructure. As of the latest reports by Al Jazeera, the death toll in Gaza stands at 34,979 Palestinians, including more than 14,500 children and 8,400 women. Additionally, over 77,643 people have been injured, and more than 8,000 are missing.\n\nThe significant destruction to Gaza\u2019s infrastructure has had a profound humanitarian impact. More than half of Gaza\u2019s homes, 360,000 residential units, have been either destroyed or damaged. Educational facilities, hospitals, places of worship, and vital water sources have also suffered extensive damage. The ongoing conflict has increased the challenges faced by the people of Gaza, who have been living under a blockade since 2007, restricting the movement of goods and people and severely limiting access to basic services.\n\nRasha Abousalem, a humanitarian aid worker and MU adjunct professor discussed the challenges of delivering aid in Gaza. \u201cOnce it reaches those checkpoints and it\u2019s transferred from Egyptian trucks into Palestinian trucks, a lot of the aid...is damaged. Some of the aid is taken, and then, after several days, to enter into the warehouses, then you have the issue of people, some groups, taking it inside Gaza and selling it on the black market,\u201d Abousalem said.\n\nNoah Citron, a community member who is part of Columbia Jews for Ceasefire, said several members of the organization were in attendance.\n\n\u201cI have been seeing a lot in the media that Jews, portrayed as a single voice, are not feeling safe at events like this. Personally, as a Jew, I felt perfectly safe,\u201d Citron said. \u201cThere was not one moment where I felt unsafe around anyone attending this protest.\u201d\n\nCitron said the protest taking place during one of the last days of Passover was particularly timely.\n\n\u201cEvery year, we talk about how the Jewish people\u2019s story of Passover kind of represents all people who are oppressed. And so I feel like this is so timely to be talking about.\u201d",

            "body": "Now I want to make it clear I see the reason for these people's agenda is obviously for the better, or at least what they think is the ethical thing to do. But at the same time, their level of thought is so misguided to the point of being just downright ignorant and foolish. 2 years ago I can say for certain 99.99% of these people likely didn't know a fucking ass thing about Israeli-Palestine at all. Heck most don't even know what the Intifidas are and probably heard Hamas for the first time ever on Oct 7th.\n\nFrom what I see their whole argument nowadays is merely based from these four lines of narratives, all of which are extremely one-sided shallow and filled with huge holes of ignorance since they cant even be bothered to do basic fucking research on the shit they regurgitate from some tiktok video they watched. Or better yet, just asking a simple word, \"why?\"\n\n***\"Oct 7th?? Nonono, it started 75 years ago! 1948 Nakba!\"***\n\n* This is a very, if not, the most common argument going around pro-Palestinian people whenever people bring up Oct 7th on why Israel has the casus belli to go to war with Hamas (and let's not get into how some of them were even denying Hamas committed 7th Oct...). Go back in history and the actual historical fact is the Palestinians brought this unto themselves. THEY started the 1948 war, not the Israelis. In 1947, the UN offered a partition plan, even giving Palestinians more fertile land, and yet the Palestinians refused while Israel willingly accepted for a peace compromise. The Arabs proceeded to start the first bloodshed and rest is history...\n\n***\"Israelis came from Europe and should go back there!\"***\n\n* This is one of the most dumbest, ignorant thoughts I keep seeing spread around and a nice piece to bring blame to Europe for the conflict. In truth Israel's demographics is far more complex than that but all these people can't even bother to do with a simple google search. Around half of Israelis actually came from the Middle East, NOT Europe, which is why you will hardly find any blonde hair blue eyed person in Israel. A lot of them also came unwillingly, driven by the antisemitism where they lived and esp after 1948.\n\n***\"Israel is occupying the West Bank!\"***\n\n* There's a two-fold argument to this one since it is indeed easy to condemn Israel's pro-settlement actions in recent years. At the same time, it pisses me off how no one seems to even question WHY Israel came to occupy the West Bank in the first place. This all came about from the 1967 Six Day War (which again, the Arabs started first with Egypt blockading the Suez Canal). The land Israel took control after that was as a security measure after they realized how vulnerable they were if the Arabs could have land so close to letting them bomb and invade the shit out of Tel Aviv if they ever so wanted to again. Is this some paranoia on the Israelis' part today? Sure, but at the same time they weren't the ones to start this shit in the first place. The Palestinians are like that little kid bully in school who hits the bigger student then runs to hide behind the teacher when the bigger student gets angry and wants to retaliate. It's the same shit that happens over and over again, and the general public, with 0.1% knowledge of history, just buys up the same victim sob story as usual.\n\n***\"The Palestinians and Jews were living in peace before the zionists came!\"***\n\n* This is another utter load of horse shit, I dont know where the fucking idea even came from (prob some stupid tiktok video for sure). The Palestinians were already at odds with the Jews from the very start and already started the beginning riots like the Jaffah riots against the Jews since 1920.   Before the mass migration of Jews, sure I guess they were \"living in peace\" when there were hardly any Jews before that in the first wave of migration from Eastern Europe.\n\nI've gotten into arguments with so many pro-Palestinian people here and all over social media before and 100% of the time, I always come at the top eventually since every fucking time, these people will regurgigate either of the same 4 points I've addressed above which can all so easily be refuted by historical hard facts. It's almost tiring at this point since I know I can't educate the whole world so yeah I guess we can only watch the chaos unfold. I also find it funny how a lot of them are the usual anti-west tards who somehow also support Russia invading Ukraine. Literally all their same arguments can be turned against them as hypocrites for the Ukraine War\n\n\nAnyway last but not least I want to clarify I'm not some pro-Israel zealot here. I just hate all the misinfo and ignorance spreading around social media driving the stupid mass protests we see today. If you ask me, this is really a never-ending war driven by stubborn extremism (jihadist Palestinians' fault) and far-right paranoia (far right Israeli's fault). ",

After *a year* of working with her (albeit, mostly for non Jewish related things, which is why I didn't know beforehand) and feeling safe enough to express everything I've been feeling since last October, I realized *yesterday, October freaking 7th* that she is super pro-pali. Like watermelon-kippah-queers-for-palestine JVP type person. \n\nWhen I began expressing how sad I've been over how this has been affecting Israelis and diaspora Jews and how absolutely horrific October 7 was, she asked me if I felt like Israel's response was proportional/ appropriate. It was right then I knew because when I said \"well, what else were they going to do? Just be ok with this large scale terrorist attack?\" and she kind of recoiled. I honestly didn't want to hear what she had to say, so I tried to keep the conversation about grieving for the victims, the hostages, their families, and Jews in general, but she kept bringing up Palestinians. \n\nI told her I recently lost a friend (was a POS, no tears shed over it) because he freaked out on me when I told him a video he had shared was full of misinformation. For context, it was a video condemning the pager attacks and talking about how Hezbollah was \"merely a political party\" and how Israel is trying to \"poke the bear,\" so to speak. I messaged him saying Hezbollah wasn't a legitimate political party, they are terrorists. I said they were the ones who killed all those kids playing soccer in northern Israel. In response he went on a profanity laden tirade about how sick he was of my \"bullshit capping for Zionist genocide\" and after a few more mean back-and-forths, I was done. \n\nSo when I told her about how ridiculous that whole conversation was, she mentioned there is more to Hezbollah than their \"armed wing.\" WHAT THE FUCK? This is a Jewish woman, how the fucking hell does she not know they are terrorists? I said, \"what? They've been imposing their regime on Lebanon for like 40+ years\" then kind of tried to move the conversation in a different way. \n\nSome other gems from the conversation:\n\n- asking if I've participated in any discussions centering on Palestinian voices, after I told her I live near many Israelis who had been directly affected by the attacks. (Actually it was in response to telling her my doctor's nephew was killed at Nova.) I told her I am truly willing to listen, but I don't know any Palestinian people personally.\n\n-  having ZERO emotion when I cried about the Bibas boys, as I was holding my 5 month old son. She mentioned the fear the Palestinian children must be going through, and I explained that *of course* I care about them too. We all do!!! That's what makes us different. We *actually* do, in fact, care about the children getting hurt by this. \n\n- asking me how I would propose making peace in the region. \n\n- not exactly agreeing with me the multiple times I called Hamas terrorists.\n\n- the worst one was when about the border blockades around Gaza, so they can't get weapons. Her response was \"yes, it's so sad they can't protect their citizens because they are blocked from obtaining weapons or forming a real army.\" Shocked, I said \"protect them from who? Who is invading them?\" Her response was \"Israel.\" What the ACTUAL fuck. \n\n- she very clearly believes it's \"not fair\" that Israel has advanced weapons of war and systems in place to protect their citizens and Gaza doesn't. \n\n- she didn't believe me when I mentioned how kids in Gaza and the west bank are indoctrinated from a young age to hate Jews, and gave an example of educational material demonizing Jews. I made up a math problem that was like \"4 glorious martyrs killed 5 evils Jews each, how many dead Jews is that\" and while that was just something I pulled out of my ass, she did not believe that anything like that was happening. She also didn't believe that Jewish kids in Israel are *not* indoctrinated this way. \n\nAGAIN, THIS WOMAN IS JEWISH. \n\nGuys, I know it's a long rant, and I really did try to discuss how much I just wanted peace and how Israel literally just wants to be left alone, but she firmly believes Israel are the bad guys and asked how I feel about \"accountability.\" When I asked what she meant, she said \"reparations and land back.\" \n\nThis woman does not know the history of the region or the history of our people.\n\nThe ONLY time during the entire conversation where she didn't have a response was when I said, \"look, there's a difference here. Israel is retaliating because of an indescribably horrible thing terrorists did to them. There's a difference between dropping bombs and what Hamas did. It was so personal. They came in and looked people in the eyes as they tortured, raped, and killed them. They laughed about it. They filmed it and posted it for all to see. Nobody is Israel is celebrating the destruction. The only think they celebrate is when a hostage returns home.\" When I told her about that one terrorist phone call where the guy was like \"mom, be so proud of me, I killed 10 Jews yay!\" she was pretty horrified and didn't challenge me on a source. \n\nOmg ok this ended up being WAAAAY longer than I intended, but I had to get it out somewhere. \n\nObviously I will be discontinuing our sessions, which is a damn shame because she has helped me immensely in many ways relating to my neurodivergece and how to finally navigate my life in a way that works for me. She cares very much for me, and thinks my kids are the best (they often pop up on the screen in our sessions). But I can no longer freely express this huge part of what's bothering me without her judgement. I never thought I'd meet a fellow Jew like this in real life. \n\nI am so bummed out, a little angry, and as a result, I donated the money I would have paid her the rest of the month to NATAL, so Israelis can get the trauma therapy and mental health help they so desperately need. \n\nThank you for listening.

However, critics of the blockade argue that it is a form of collective punishment that disproportionately harms the civilian population.\n\nThe United Nations has repeatedly called on Israel to lift the blockade, stating that it violates international law. The ICC has also opened an investigation into the blockade, which could lead to charges against Israeli officials.\n\nWhether or not Israel's cutting off food, water, and fuel supplies to 2 million Palestinians violates international law is a complex question that is still under debate. However, there is a strong consensus among international law experts that the blockade is illegal.\n\nBard",

This book must be so thorough and iron clad to so enthusiastically throw your credibility behind it, as there are hundreds of people here researching this conflict alongside the streamer surely you won't just bank on no one *actually* reading it... \n\nOf course, that's me projecting how I think onto an idiot; a classic blunder. \n\nI doubt he read any of this book (let alone the citations), as Finkelstein's *Method and Madness* falls in line with his other, largely maligned, work. See reception of his more infamous book *[The Holocaust Industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust_Industry#Reviews_and_critiques)*.\n\nHad I known how trivial challenging Finkelstein's work would be, I would have done it the same day. In the books very first page of the first chapter it lays quite bare that it is an unserious work, and is exclusively interested in pushing a narrative of an innocent Palestinian resistance against a \"Sparta-like society\".\n\n#A \"Stickler for Facts\" and the Ouroboros of Self-Citation\n\nI'd like to start with this [first page of the first chapter](https://i.imgur.com/lstKEJa.png), as it doesn't improve from there. \n\nWhat you include as a historian is just as important as what you exclude. \n\n>In January 2006, disgusted by years of official corruption and fruitless negotiations, Palestinians elected the Islamic movement Hamas into office. Israel immediately tightened its blockade of Gaza, and the US joined in.\n\nOnce again in an analysis of Israel/Palestine, Egypt seems to just vanish and he instead includes the United States. No motive is ever given for the blockade, no statement, citation, or explanation. As far as Finkelstein is concerned it just \"happened\".\n\n> It was demanded of the newly elected government that it renounce violence, and recognize Israel as well as prior Israeli-Palestinian agreements. These preconditions for international engagement were unilateral, not reciprocal. Israel wasn\u2019t required to renounce violence. It wasn\u2019t compelled to withdraw from the occupied territories, enabling Palestinians to exercise their right to statehood. And, whereas Hamas was obliged to recognize prior agreements, such as the Oslo Accord, which undercut basic Palestinian rights,5 Israel was free to eviscerate prior agreements, such as the 2003 \u201cRoad Map.\u201d6\n\nThere are a few things here. \n\nFirstly, there's not even a passing attempted to be even somewhat clinical in an assessment of the facts and context of the time. It freely flows between personal condemnations of the author interspersed between facts and outright falsehoods.\n\nAgain, the reasons Israel was keen on the terrorist organization denouncing violence, was because the same terrorist organization that became the government [was regularly suicide bombing Israel throughout the early 2000's.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Palestinian_suicide_attacks#2000s) As you'd expect Finkelstein completely and entirely omits Hamas' terrorist activities, and by his reading you'd expect that this is just Israel making absurd demands of a democratically elected government.\n\n>Israel was free to eviscerate prior agreements, such as the 2003 \u201cRoad Map.\u201d6\n\nIsrael did not agree to the 2003 \"Road Map\", [his own source states as much.](https://i.imgur.com/f0ywKy8.png) This deadlock over the [PA being unable to control Palestinian terrorism is not in dispute.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_map_for_peace#Start_and_deadlock:~:text=By%20the%20end,eventually%20reached%20deadlock.)\n\nAt no point was Israel in any way bound to the 2003 \"Road Map\" proposed by the Quartet. They did not agree to it, they made (rather absurd) demands before they could agree to it.\n\n>In June 2007, Hamas consolidated its control over Gaza when it preempted a coup attempt orchestrated by Washington in league with Israel and elements of the Palestinian Authority (PA).7 After Hamas checked this \u201cdemocracy promotion\u201d initiative of US President George W. Bush, Israel and Washington retaliated by tightening the screws on Gaza yet further. \n\n\"Preempting a coup\" is an interesting way to put purging the previous democratic government and refusing to hold another elections. At the time of publishing this book Hamas had not held elections in 5 years, a curiously absent detail in his recounting of how \"Hamas checked this \"democracy promotion\" initiative\".\n\n>In June 2008, Hamas and Israel entered into a cease-fire brokered by Egypt, but in November of that year Israel violated the cease-fire by carrying out a bloody border raid on Gaza. Israel\u2019s modus operandi recalled a February 1955 border raid during the buildup to the 1956 Sinai invasion.8 The objective, then and now, was to instigate a backlash that Israel could exploit as a pretext for a full-blown assault.\n\nAgain, the negotiations and demands of either side are curiously absent [despite being publicly available at the time](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/mideast/R40101.pdf). Israel refused to lift the blockade, rouge elements unmanaged by Hamas in Gaza still fired rockets into Israel during this cease fire and Hamas refuses to return the captured soldier Gilad Shali. Why leave these details out? In favor of what you ask? What is the author's citation number 8 there? What's that source? [Finkelstein's \nfucking citing himself.](https://i.imgur.com/QokE6m2.png) \n\nHe is citing as evidence, that Israel's doctrine is to deliberately instigate backlash in order to respond with overwhelming force, his own book.\n\nNow, dear reader I'm sure you're thinking, \"Hey 4thot, I've read other works of serious historians and they cite their previous work sometimes because it's a large body of knowledge they've previously collected about their area of expertise, it's actually quite common, especially in some esoteric history because there simply isn't another authority.\", and if this post was about a serious academic that produced a serious piece of work... you might have been right.\n\nThis \"stickler for facts\" is citing the same passage that was ***literally Copy + Pasted*** into his other book.

You must evacuate your home immediately and go south of Wadi Gaza.\n\n>For your safety and security: You must not return to your home until further notice from the Israel Defense Forces.

A press secretary of the UN, who told Axios the following. \n\n>[Meanwhile, Dujarric told Axios: \"Today, just before midnight local time, team leaders of the UN Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Department of Safety and Security in Gaza were informed by their liaison officers in the Israeli military that the entire population of Gaza north of Wadi Gaza should relocate to southern Gaza within the next 24 hours.](https://www.axios.com/2023/10/13/israel-gaza-hamas-evacuate-un-ground-operation#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20Dujarric,next%2024%20hours.)\n\nIt is not provided what division of the IDF Liaison Unit spoke to them, nor their exact statement. \n\nDujarric reiterated in a [noon press briefing](https://press.un.org/en/2023/db231013.doc.htm) the next day:\n\n>I think we shared with you some details of what happened last night, which was that team leaders of the UN Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Department of Safety and Security in Gaza were informed by the Israeli liaison officers in the Israeli military that the entire population of Gaza north of Wadi Gaza should relocate to southern Gaza within 24 hours.  That was as of midnight, local time, last night.\n\nWhen pressed for how he got the 24 hour timeline, or the Israeli disagreement he did not provide an answer.\n\n>Question:  Steph, I asked you before, but I am looking for an update.  Twenty-four hours was what the Israeli military liaisons had told UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and we're seeing some reports that the Israeli military is saying it's not a definite timeline.\n\n>**Spokesman**:  I think you need to\u2026 All those questions should be asked to the Israeli military.\n\n[...]\n\n>**Spokesman**:  I can't\u2026 I mean, I can only tell you what we've been told, but it's not for me to speak on their behalf in order of their timelines.\n\n>Question:  No.  I totally understand.  Have they updated any information to you on the timeline?\n\n>**Spokesman**:  I mean, we are\u2026 it is clear to us that the clock is ticking.  Linda, then Ephrem.\n\nAll parties are correct when they said a 24 hour evacuation of Gaza was impossible, which is why the IDF never made one.\n\n**The 24 hour claim was rebutted the same day.** The journalist questioning Dujarric is referring to statements made by the head of the IDF Liaison Unit, Daniel Hagari:\n\n>IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari says Israel's military is aware that evacuating 1.1 million people from northern Gaza - as Israel has called for - will take some time.\n\n>[\"This is a war zone, we are trying to provide them the time and we are doing a lot of effort, and we understand it won\u2019t take 24 hours,\" he said in response to a BBC question at a briefing just now about Israel's timeframe,](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-middle-east-67096916/page/4#:~:text=IDF%20spokesperson%20Daniel,Gazans%2C%20Hagari%20responded%3A)\n\n>He pointed out that Hamas was telling people to ignore Israel's order.\n\n>\"We understand the problem. Sad reality? It\u2019s Hamas\u2019 responsibility.\"\n\n>When pressed on whether he was saying the IDF understood it would take more than 24 hours to evacuate Gazans, Hagari responded:\n\n>\"We understand it will take time. This is all I\u2019ve said.\" from IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari\n\n#The Impossible Standard\n\nMy question for Lycan, and any other Hamas simps that can barely stomach reading a basic accounting of facts that doesn't paint Israel as bloodthirsty conquerors that enjoy shooting children:\n\nWhat should Israel have done for you to not accuse them of inhumane war crimes with their evacuation?\n\nThe posted the evacuation orders, they posted footage of the evacuation orders being dropped, they posted the same message across their social media, they posted the evacuation briefing online, they gave direct and clear goals to the civilians of Palestine where to go, why, and how they'd receive aid, in multiple languages. They dropped pamphlets to spread the message as much as they could to prevent Hamas from controlling evacuation information, and the contacted people directly to evacuate. \n\nThis is behavior of a country that seems to be taking care to prevent civilian casualties, not cause them. This is behavior of a country that understands that mass civilian causalities are unacceptable, and yet their evacuation of civilians in the wake of an invasion against a terrorist organization that uses human shields is condemned?\n\nIt's curious how a single statement by a non-credible spokesperson so easily overwhelms the body of information available to everyone with an internet connection regarding this evacuation. And again, I'm forced to wonder about the people that actually bought \"24 hour evacuation\" in the wake of all the misinformation, and shoddy journalism around this conflict.\n\nDid you genuinely think Israel is so stupid that they'd actually demand south Gaza evacuate in *24 hours*? Did you consider the tremendous incompetence required to make that patently absurd demand for even half a second before your gullible, empty, head swallowed it wholesale? Does it not embarrass you to be so clueless? So blatantly uncritical?",

During roughly 10 years of fighting and Saudi air/naval blockades, nearly 400,000 people in Yemen have died and millions displaced. The death toll of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (which has lasted about a century) is in the tens of thousands IIRC. Saudi Arabia has caused a much greater degree of human suffering in Yemen than Israel has in Gaza. Saudi aircraft have also attacked school buses full of children and bombed prisons. The Saudis have also denied aid to Yemeni civilians (sound familiar?) and have killed civilians demonstrating against the KSA's presence.\n\nSaudi Arabia's campaign in Yemen is still the story of a larger and wealthier country invading a smaller poorer one and using the justification of fighting armed militants. The fact that the perpetrators of the plight of Yemenis are other Arabs should not make it any more palatable than what is happening in Gaza. Plus, America is still supplying weapons to Saudi Arabia and has recently lifted a ban on offensive arms supplies to the KSA. Arguably, Saudi Arabia is much more important to the global economy than Israel is. Why are there not as many protests worldwide condemning Saudi Arabia's actions in Yemen? Why is there no BDS movement for Saudi Arabia?",

            "body": "This isn't a \"what happened to Sam\" type post, I'm willing to accept that he's always been this way and I just never noticed because of various reasons. Despite the fact that I vehemently disagree with just about everything he has to say about the current hostilities in Gaza, I have been forcing myself to listen to these recent podcasts in a hope that it would help me to steelman the other side of my views. In reality, what I've found is what appears to be a catastrophically obtuse and naive version of Sam Harris that makes him out to be something of a rube that I have a hard time taking seriously.\n\nI want to be clear that I don't think he's lying, being purposefully unfair, or being sly here. I think he genuinely believes the things he says about this topic and genuinely attempts to bring in people he views as experts on Israel/Gaza. In fact, it almost makes it worse to me that this is the case as it leaves no real room for this to be a thought experiment of some kind.\n\nSome points:\n\n1. Sam continually just assumes that the government of Israel is acting in accordance with what it says it wants to do even when events and news reports show the exact opposite. I'm not saying everyone should be a tinfoil hat conspiracist about the government but just saying \"well the government says it cares about civilians so obviously they must\" is unfathomably naive.\n2. Sam continually notes the violence of Hamas as being religiously based and noting the unique issue of violence in sects of Islam (which I agree with) while simultaneously ignoring explicitly religious framing of the war from the Israeli government.\n   1. \u201cYou must remember what Amalek has done to you.\u201d -- Netanyahu\n      1. 1 Samuel 15:3: \"now go and smite amalek, utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.\"\n3. Sam's constant assertion that there could have been peace all along if the Palestinians would work with Israel and that Israel would pursue a peaceful 2 state outcome if Hamas would just stop saying \"Death to Israel\".\n   1. Netanyahu has been perhaps the most central character in ensuring there could be no two-state solution and therefore no peace. He has openly touted his role in sabotaging the peace process, taken credit for being the reason why there is no two-state solution, and has noted that supporting Hamas was an important goal of his government specifically to ensure he had no \"reasonable\" counterpart to sue for peace with.\n      1. [https://www.timesofisrael.com/pointing-to-hamass-little-state-netanyahu-touts-role-blocking-2-state-solution/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/pointing-to-hamass-little-state-netanyahu-touts-role-blocking-2-state-solution/)\n      2. [https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/)\n   2. Additionally, the UN has actually had resolutions on resolving the Palestinian statehood question for decades with essentially every country in the UN other than the US and Israel supporting it. This also includes the non-voting delegation representing Palestine.\n4. Sam continually says that there was no occupation and the term apartheid doesn't apply to Israel's treatment of Palestinians.\n   1. When one country controls the daily lives of people of another country and uses its military to displace people from their homes to make way for their own citizens to settle in land that is not theirs, that's called an occupation. Gaza is for all intents and purposes occupied by Israel, not having soldiers inside of the walls does not mean there is no occupation.\n   2. Former head of Mossad, Israeli commanders, and the UN all pretty clearly state that what was happening to Palestinians could credibly meet the international legal definition of apartheid. Specifically the 2 primary elements of systematic oppression by the dominant group over the marginalized group and inhumane acts such as expropriation of landed property.\n5. Sam enjoys trotting out recent surveys saying that even if Palestinians don't support Hamas they support what happened on October 7th. Consistently says that Israelis wouldn't behave this way.\n   1. Duh, the average Palestinian's view of Israel is that it is an occupying force that has been now relentlessly bombing everything in sight for 5 months. People get pretty bloodthirsty in these situations -- remember the US after 9/11. You can argue over who started it as long as you want, but in the end if you ask a regular Palestinian now how they feel about Israel of course they're going to say \"kill em all\" that's not surprising.\n   2. There are too many examples of Israeli citizens brutalizing people in the West Bank, openly calling for genocide, and of the government treating anti-war protestors differently than pro war protesters but I'll add one article from a mainstream source Sam would view as legitimate.\n      1. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/02/10/gaza-aid-blockade-protest-kerem-shalom/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/02/10/gaza-aid-blockade-protest-kerem-shalom/)\n   3. Also just too many videos to count of IDF soldiers looting Palestinian houses and wandering through Gaza purposely blowing up residential structures and laughing while standing out in the open obviously not concerned about Hamas hiding anywhere.\n   4. Videos of IDF soldiers singing with celebrities at rallies \"We're finishing off Gaza.\"\n6. Sam just flat out ignores the constant stream of quotes coming from the Israeli government that are explicitly referring to Palestinians as animals. I don't mean the minister of vending machines or whatever low level government lunatic I mean people with actual power either in the government now or previously of the government advising the current regime.\n   1. Dan Gillerman: \"I'm very puzzled by the constant concern which the world is showing for the Palestinian people and is actually showing for these horrible inhuman animals who have done the worst atrocities that the century has ever seen.\"\n   2. Yoav Gallant: \"Gaza won't return to what it was before. We will eliminate everything.\"\n   3. Giora Eiland: \"Gaza will become a place where no human being can exist.\"\n   4. Galit Distel Atbaryan: \"Invest this energy in one thing: erasing all of Gaza from the face of the Earth. The Gazan monsters will fly to the southern fence and try to enter Egyptian territory or they will die. Gaza should be erased.\"\n   5. Moshe Feiglin: \"Annihilate Gaza now! Now! Gaza needs to turn into Dresden! Yes!\" (exclamations relevant he was screaming when he said this)\n   6. On and on and on\n7. Sam continuously pretends that the world doesn't care about what happened on October 7th or diminishes it which seems pretty patently false. If anything, recent evidence from the NY Times shows that the world has been overemphasizing many claims from what happened on October 7th. What actually happened was horrific enough, but numerous sources from within NY Times saying their biggest story about it completely blew up under scrutiny and was actually written largely by someone with no real background in journalism but who had been in an IDF intelligence squad.\n   1. [https://theintercept.com/2024/02/28/new-york-times-anat-schwartz-october-7/](https://theintercept.com/2024/02/28/new-york-times-anat-schwartz-october-7/)\n   2. Anyone with an interest should take some time to read up on that NY Times fight happening right now it's pretty wild\n8. The tired and frankly lazy constant claims of antisemitism when people criticize Israel's handling of the war are pretty tedious. People pretend like the world was all on board with the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We were constantly being accused of war crimes and even we showed more restraint in our worst offenses than Israel is now.\n   1. One example being the fact that the US limited itself to the use of 500LB bombs in these wars whereas Israel has used hundreds of 2,000LB bombs in Gaza.\n9. The ICJ case. Either the majority of the western world honestly feels that Israel is at least potentially committing a genocide or this is all part of an international and deep seated hatred of the Jews.\n\nHonestly I could go on and on and on here but I'm getting tired of even myself at this point. I might continue listening to see how Sam explains away the recent events of the IDF slaughtering over 100 Palestinians trying to get to a food truck for aid. It would be interesting to see his take on the fact that the video produced by Israel to claim it wasn't IDF soldiers was visibly edited, the sound was removed, and you can see tracer rounds flying through the air.\n\nI'll leave it at this I guess. Sam has just disappointed me here, and that's fine. He's a grown man who owes me nothing and is free to believe whatever he wants. But I'd be lying if I said it didn't bother me that someone I view as overall wanting the truth has gone so far out of his way to not even attempt to have someone on who disagrees with his views on this. The repetitive and condescending dismissiveness of anyone who disagrees with his views on this conflict as just being \"morally confused\" is just lazy and unbecoming. It's possible to be horrified by what Hamas did on October 7, accept that Hamas is a terrorist organization, and accept they must be destroyed while simultaneously saying you can't just wantonly kill everyone you see in an effort to \"get the bad guys\".\n\nAnd moreover you can't say you're \"defending western civilization\" as Bibi likes to say while you completely disregard the institutions and norms that western civilization has created to keep itself from devolving into barbarism.\n\n\\*EDIT\\* I was inarticulate with my title in that I'm not going to just stop listening to Sam's podcast generally. I was more intending this to be around his podcasts around Gaza/Israel. I am a premium sub and will continue to be a premium sub as I believe in his non advertiser model and I believe in long form conversations about heterodox topics. This was just pointed at what I view as an incredible blind spot for Sam and airing a disagreement I have with the way he's been handling this.\n\n\\*EDIT 2\\* reading through the comments and DMs I've gotten has been very heartening I must say. Not because it's a bunch of support for my view or agreement with my post. It's a pretty diverse mix on that front. But because the vast majority of people detracting from  me are saying things like:\n\n1. You are stupid\n2. You don't know what you're talking about\n3. You are drawing the wrong conclusions\n4. You are ignorant of history\n\nThese are entirely valid responses in my view. It's not like I posted this here of all places expecting a warm and sunny reception. The reason I find this heartening is that I've experienced a vanishingly small number (relatively) of comments saying \"you do not agree with what I'm saying therefore you must be an anti-semite who hates jews and loves hamas\". There are people saying that, but I have to say it's significantly fewer people than I expected which in an odd way is very hopeful to me.\n\nAt least if you're saying you think I'm an idiot you come across as having an honest response to what I'm saying. The people who reflexively just say that I must be an anti-semite (one person asked how much Russia is paying me lol) because I am criticizing specific ways a government is prosecuting a war come across as just the Intellectual Dark Web versions of woke college kids calling everything they don't like fascism and racism. So all in all good mix. Thank you.\n\n\\*Final Edit\\* Now that this has died down substantially thank you everyone for engaging with the post including those who think I'm completely wrong. I did through conversations here decide to make some minor edits to my original post to clarify. It was made clear to me that on a few occasions I conflated Gaza and the general experience of Palestinians as a whole (including the West Bank) so I made some edits to delineate who and what I'm talking about more clearly.\n\nIn two days this got over 56,000 views, 411 comments, 130 shares, and had an upvote rate of 74%. I'm glad to have written something that got so many people talking here and selfishly pleased to see that I'm not alone in my frustrations. Some mentioned hoping Sam addresses this post, which isn't the point. I know for a fact he's read this post because this sub is the only social media he has admitted to still using and he is a recovering social media addict. There is no way in hell he doesn't read every post on this sub. That being said, my pie in the sky hope was that maybe he'd read this and start diversifying the people he has on his show talking about this issue. Also admittedly airing some frustration.\n\nThank you everyone. Take care.",

It also removed restrictions that Palestinians serving more than 15 years could be freed as part of the deal.\n\nHamas demanded that Russia, China and Turkey also act as guarantors that Israel would stop the fighting. The initial proposal backed by Israel and the US listed Egypt, Qatar and the US as guarantors.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, a senior Hamas official told reporters that the group demanded that it also be allowed to select a list of 100 Palestinian prisoners with long-term sentences that would be released from Israeli jails.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken had said on Wednesday that the Palestinian group had made numerous amendments to the US-backed ceasefire plan, some of which he deemed unworkable.\n\nThe key point of contention among Hamas was that the second phase and a transition to a permanent ceasefire be guaranteed, something which Israel has refused to accept.\n",

As such, there is no blockade in the true meaning of the word , but a checkpoint to ensure Gaza be arms free (or arms reduces), which even Steven says is a good goal to achieve. \n\nI think that in order to determine who is correct here, we need to understand what actually happens to goods at the border. \n\nI was wondering, if before 10/7, what was the actual blockade blocking? \nIf indeed it only blocked out weapons, and if a merchant wanted to buy carrots or PlayStations or whatever he could freely, then I think that there is no true blockade in any meaningful form, as free movement of goods occurs. If, on the other hand, limits are sets on goods like food, clothing, etc.. then I would say that there is a blockade, as it limits the free trade of goods. \n\nSo if it is indeed the first option, I would say that Steven saying that once Gaza is completely demilitarized the blockade should be lifted is nonsensical, as in order to keep Gaza demilitarized (which Steven supports), you need the checkpoint to make sure no weapons enter (as there is no other way to make sure it isn\u2019t re-militarized). If on the other hand it is the second option, it makes sense to say that there is a blockade and support reducing it to only a checkpoint of arms, so that free civilian goods enter without interference, while the demilitarization continues. \n\nDoes anyone know what the actual process was pre 10/7? Was it basically a screening process for weapons or the limitation of civilian goods in any way? Is it is the second one, what are the limits, for what types of goods? Who decides this?",

Many families in poverty were forced to spend a third or more of their income to purchase water from unregulated sources, with the hopes that it is safe. Now, this already dire situation is exponentially worse.\n\nSoon after Israel occupied the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, in June 1967, the Israeli military authorities consolidated complete power over all water resources and water-related infrastructure in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT). 50 years on, Israel continues to control and restrict Palestinian access to water in the OPT to a level which neither meets their needs nor constitutes a fair distribution of shared water resources.\n\nIn November 1967 the Israeli authorities issued Military Order 158, which stated that Palestinians could not construct any new water installation without first obtaining a permit from the Israeli army. Since then, the extraction of water from any new source or the development of any new water infrastructure would require permits from Israel, which are near impossible to obtain. Palestinians living under Israel\u2019s military occupation continue to suffer the devastating consequences of this order until today. They are unable to drill new water wells, install pumps or deepen existing wells, in addition to being denied access to the Jordan River and fresh water springs. Israel even controls the collection of rain water throughout most of the West Bank, and rainwater harvesting cisterns owned by Palestinian communities are often destroyed by the Israeli army. As a result, some 180 Palestinian communities in rural areas in the occupied West Bank have no access to running water, according to OCHA. Even in towns and villages which are connected to the water network, the taps often run dry.\n\nhttps://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2017/11/the-occupation-of-water/\n\nhttps://www.hrw.org/news/2023/11/16/israeli-authorities-cutting-water-leading-public-health-crisis-gaza",

            "body": "Transcript of what Peyrin Kao said here: [youtu.be/wf63XKv77Mo](https://youtu.be/wf63XKv77Mo?si=N5ehLVY7ajbDIhPF)  \nDone by me without his knowledge or input.  \nExplanation at bottom about how this was transcribed. \n\n# Disclaimer to all students\n\nAt this point, the 61B lecture is over. If you want to go, you can. But this is actually my last lecture for the semester. Justin is lecturing the rest of the way; it's all optional fun stuff. Since this is my last chance to talk to you all, and also to those out in the recording in the world, I have a couple of things I want to say. I want to make it clear that this is only on my behalf. Like nobody on the 61B staff knows about this. No one actually knows about this, period. Like Justin, do you know what I'm about to say at all? Like I haven't told you, right? Okay.\n\nI just wanted to leave you with some thoughts about life, and what you've learned, and what you can take forward from this class in general. That's what I want to talk about. This lecture is over, so if you want to go, you can go. You can just pretend that I have left and then I just came back, and this is a lecture hall that no one is using. Is that fair? Everyone knows the lecture is over. You can go home. I'm not here as your instructor or whatever. I'm just some guy who found an empty lecture hall and is here talking. Is that fair? Okay, I am recording this. Yeah, okay. Hopefully, it's okay with everyone. I just want to make sure.\n\nWith that in mind, again, if you want to go, leave halfway through. I don't care. Something I do want to say is, I mean, this is something I've been spending a lot of time thinking about, and something I've been spending my weekends thinking about as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Some context\n\nI don't know if you all have been following the news or whatever, but there's been a situation going on in Gaza. The news stories that come out just break my heart, man. They've been bombing hospitals, they've been bombing schools, and they've been killing journalists, children, women. The thing about Gaza, which I don't know how many, you know, I had to learn as well and get informed too, but is everyone aware that in Gaza, you can't leave? This is not, \"Oh, I can just go somewhere else, whatever.\" There's a blockade happening there by the Israeli government, and it means that the people inside cannot leave. There's no option to go. There's no airport to leave. There are no boats taking people out. It is a closed, open-air prison is what people are calling it because you can't leave.\n\nThat is something that I think maybe a lot of people don't realize, but I wanted to get the word out there. Something else is that, because there's this blockade, resources can't go inside either. This blockade means that the Israeli government gets to decide what goes in and out (correction: Rafah border crossing is controlled by Egypt, but Israel has cut off all humanitarian aid to Gaza from its border crossings). So they have stopped the flow of electricity. These people inside don't have power to power their hospitals or cook food. They don't have water. They don't have food. Supplies are running out. There are hospitals that just can't function because they've been bombed or because there's no electricity to support it.\n\nThe reason why I'm saying all this, by the way. I'm sorry to throw all this emotion on you, but I'll link it back to 61B and why we're all here in just a moment. I just wanted to make sure we're all aware of the situation. If you're not, literally just go on Google. The horror stories I see every day break my heart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Qualifying my position\n\nSo, at this point, I know that people are about to come for my job. I was already told I shouldn't be doing this. Before you come for my job or whatever, I need to dispel a couple of things. I know when I'm talking to my bosses, they'll say, \"Oh, you didn't condemn Hamas,\" whatever. Hopefully, I have made it very clear that I am not in favor of bombing innocent civilians in hospitals, schools, whatever.\n\nBut I also do want to remind you all that the attacks that happened in October are not an excuse to bomb people back. That's not how that works. You don't just say, \"Oh, well, some people got bombed so I'm going to bomb them back.\" That's not how that works, okay?\n\nI also want to remind you that history did not start in October. We were here talking about Java before October. There were things that happened before the attacks in October. There's 75 years of Palestinian history of oppression, ethnic cleansing, genocide that's been happening for the past 75 years. There have been people in Palestine who've been taken political prisoner for decades and haven't been awarded a fair trial or anything at all.\n\nSo, sure, we talk about releasing the Israeli hostages, and I'm in favor of that too. But let's also, at the same time, not be afraid to talk about the Palestinian hostages who are being held by the Israeli government. Let's not be afraid to talk about the hostages who are in Gaza and cannot leave. I think that's a hostage situation too.\n\nIf anyone wants to accuse me of being a terrorist sympathizer or whatever, I want to make it very clear that I'm not, and that's not what I'm here for. If you want to also come to me, \"Oh, you're anti-Semitic and anti-Israel,\" I want to make it clear that anti-Semitism is not anti-Zionism. They are different things.\n\nWhen I was out here, by the way, these are all my own photos from the past four, five weekends (showing slides containing images of local pro-Palestine demonstrations). When we are out here, I'm not standing against my Jewish brothers, sisters, and siblings, but I'm standing with them because we say that we don't want this to happen again and not in their name. I just wanted to get that out there in case I get fired or whatever. I am not sympathizing with terrorists or anything that may be interpreted that way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Why I care about this\n\nSo, I realized I just dropped a lot of stuff on you. Now I want to bring it back to why this matters to you, why this matters to me. You might be thinking, \"Credit to you for saying this, but this isn't the only thing that's happening in the world. Why haven't you talked about anything else that's been happening?\" And you know what? Maybe you're right. But one other thing that I really want to emphasize that makes this so important to us and makes it so that this is not something that's just happening to other people in the world who are, you know, on the other side of the globe, why does it concern me? It's who is funding this.\n\nThe US is the biggest backer of Israel and its current bombing campaign in Gaza. My tax dollars are being used to fund the bombing of children, hospitals, schools, universities, safe zones. As someone who is funding this, I think I have a right to say something against it. I did not consent to using my money for this. You might say, \"Let's just go vote out the people who said this.\" But who do I vote for? I look in the Senate. They're voting like 97 to 0 to give Israel more funding. In the Senate, 97 to 0 means everyone from Ted Cruz to Bernie Sanders votes for it. Do you know how hard it is to get Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders to agree on something? And they agree on this. Give me a break.\n\nSo, I think if my tax dollars are being used to fund this, and your tax dollars are being used to fund this, I think I have a right to say something about it in the space that I have. Maybe it's selfish of me to say, \"Oh, I have a space here to talk about it,\" but I think you do too. This is where I'm going to bring it back to 61B.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# How this relates to you\n\nSo, what have you learned in this class? Sure, I could sit here and tell you all about, oh, we learned about a summary of sorting, we talked about priority queues, but, you know, to be realistic, are you really going to remember what radix sort is in like 10 years without looking it up? Probably not. Okay, and that's okay. I'm not offended. You know, I didn't remember what LLRB's where before I came and taught this class again, and that was like, you know, five, six years ago for me.\n\nBut what I really want you to take away from this class personally, and maybe everyone else has different opinions, and that's okay, but I think that from 61B, what you have gained is the power to be successful. I don't know how else to say this really, but you've gained the privilege to get a Berkeley degree in computer science, which is not just some crummy piece of paper. The Berkeley degree in computer science or data science is going to unlock so many opportunities and paths for you to be successful out there.\n\nYou can go out and get a software engineering job that pays twice or three times whatever the hell I make. You can go out and do consulting work or engineering and build amazing, complicated things and contribute to massive projects that change governments, change how we live as a society, change the world. Right? If you go work for a tech company, Facebook, Google, whatever, you're changing the way in which people in the world get information.\n\nOr if you go out and work for the government or work for any of these major companies, or go out and design self-driving cars, you're changing the way that people get around or you're changing the world, really. You have been given the power to go out and use everything you've learned in this class, the ability to write all this complex code, manage the complexity, and work with other people. You've been given the privilege and the power to go out and change the world.\n\nSo what I really want to impress on you is that because you have been given this power, I think it's important to know what that power can be used for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The importance of ethics in technology\n\nAnd I know that there's already been talk; I'm sure you've heard all about, you know, oh, there's ethics in AI and, you know, there's, uh, I don't know, you know, all these other, like, tech-related things, and you're like, \"Wait a minute, you know, this Gaza thing, sure, it's an issue, but what does it have to do with me? I'm someone who's going to work in engineering and technology. So what does this have to do with me?\" But it does, right?\n\nSo, something I've heard from all the people that I've talked to out here, and you know, I've been trying my best to listen, and I'm not going to sit up here and pretend, like, \"Well, I'm an expert, listen to me, whatever.\" I'm just one guy who's trying to do his best to learn about the issues. So one thing I've heard from a lot of people which really resonated with me is that we are not free until Palestine is free. So what does that mean? Well, I think you can interpret it lots of different ways. I'm not going to tell you how to interpret it, but to me, what it means is that all of our struggles are interconnected.\n\nSo when you go out and work for something like, let's go develop some AI that's going to recognize people's faces or whatever, well, that kind of technology is something that all these armies are using to identify people and protesters and try to prosecute them. Like, that's connected. Or, you know, if you go out and work for social media companies, right? You're like, \"Wait, that's nothing to do with me. What does it have to do with all this stuff? I thought this is not related to me. I'm the CS major. Get this, like, liberal arts crap away from me.\n\n\"But, um, it's connected because if you go out and work for some social media company, like, think about all the disinformation we've been seeing about this conflict. We've been seeing, you know, I mean, heck, even the fact that people are calling it a conflict, and people think, \"Oh, it's a war between two sides that have equal capability.\" It's not a war. It's a genocide. There's one side that is absolutely being wiped out and bombed indiscriminately, and I think that's something that's not getting out there. And as someone who designs social media platforms and has the ability to go and change the way in which people receive information, you too have a big place in this struggle. It's not just, \"Oh, I'm a CS major. There's nothing to do with CS.\" They're connected, okay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Funding and Priorities\n\nAnd I mean, even for me, sure, I don't have a tech job or whatever, but I work in education. Even something like the education sector, I feel connected to this too. So, think about it. Has anyone had trouble getting into 61B or any other classes? Has that been something everyone's been experiencing? Once you get to the upper divs, I promise you'll have trouble getting into classes, no question, right? Has everyone been experiencing those 100-minute office hour wait times that we're trying our best to get through? You know those, right? Or even just posting on Ed, waiting two days, no answer because there's just so few of us and so many of you, right? We're all underpaid, overworked. There are too many of you coming in, but why does it have to be that way?\n\nWhy is it that, you know, I have to be here, teaching all these different classes, and all of our TAs have to, you know, we tell them not to overwork, but we end up all just doing what we can to help you, and we still can't get to all of you. Why do we have to turn you away when you need help? Well, why aren't we funded? Why is the EECS department so chronically underfunded this way? I'm not saying there's a direct correlation. I'm not going to accuse the EECS department of whatever. But as a state-funded school and as a government-funded, publicly funded university, there are priorities in this country, and somehow the priority in this country is not to fund the education that you are paying a load of tuition for.\n\nSomehow, all this money is getting funneled into sending bombs to other countries so they can bomb children in hospitals. Like, you know, that's something that resonates with me because I think that part of my struggle to get you all the education that I think you deserve is connected to the fact that our governments are okay with underfunding the EECS Department over and over and over again until we have no money left to support any of you. Meanwhile, it seems like every time Israel needs more bombs, they can always pull up the money that they need. How? How can that be right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# It doesn't feel right\n\nSo, I find those kind of things connected. When I see the people of Palestine band together and live through really what is just some of the most horrific things, like, I've ever seen in my life, I see that stuff. I don't even know if I can watch it sometimes. Like God. And, you know, when I see this stuff, part of me, of course, feels like pity and sympathy. Part of me feels anger\u2014anger that my tax dollars are being used to fund it, anger that your tax dollars and tuitions are being used to fund it. I mean, what kind of tuition are you paying to get this kind of subpar staff support? I'm okay with saying it. Like, we do our best, but it's ultimately not what you deserve. What kind of tuition are you paying? I paid like five figures, you know? I don't know how much are we talking these days. Has tuition gone up recently? I don't even know. Forget the housing and all that. What, 100,000, 200,000? I don't know, man. It's just so much, and you're not getting what you deserve as students.\n\nI think that, you know, even there, the struggle is interconnected. We are connected to these people in ways that even I'm still learning about. Anyway, when I see these things, you know, some part of me feels pity and sympathy, and part of me feels anger again that I'm here and I can do anything about it. My representatives are all out there voting to send them more bombs, and there's nothing I can do about it, except I guess, you know, selfishly come up here and waste all of your time talking about this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Standing in solidarity\n\nSomething else that I feel, which I think is so much stronger than any of those other feelings of pity or sympathy or even anger, is at a very deep level, I feel solidarity with these people. The people of Palestine are out here suffering things that I will never, ever have to suffer, God willing, and things that I will never be able to even imagine\u2014the horrors of an entire family being wiped out. There are people whose entire families have been wiped out, and that last name just doesn't exist anymore. I just think about that, and I'm like, how can I even imagine what that's like? There are people out there who have lost their homes, have been forced to go to other places, and then still been bombed. I can't imagine what that's like.\n\nAnd again, I think it's fair to feel pity and sympathy, and I think that's a valid thing to feel. But I also, on a deep level, feel solidarity. The people of Palestine give me the bravery to stand up here and tell you about this, even if it costs me my job, my reputation, whatever. Like, I think this is important enough to come up here and tell you about it. And, again, I want to remind you that all these struggles, to me, they're interconnected. So when you go out and you have the power to change the world, really\u2014I know it sounds so utopian and like, really, but, you know, software and computer science really is one of these forefront fields.\n\nWhen you go out, when you have the power to write code that is complex and the ability to manage it, and heck, the ability to take the stuff we've learned, use it in your software engineering interviews, and get all the jobs that you want, that kind of thing gives you power. It gives you privilege. You might have the money to do something about this. You might have the ability to contribute to companies that are either actively supporting or opposing or doing something about injustices like this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Parting thoughts\n\nHey, maybe like 10 years down the line, there will be something else that comes up, and that's okay. I don't need you to remember any specific struggle or whatever, but I want you to remember that this overall struggle for justice, for equality, it is something that we are all in together. When you go out and when you go out with this power that we've given you, the power to, again, really change the world with the ability to program and construct software that you've been given, I just want to remind you that that power comes with a lot of responsibility. I really hope that when you go out, you remember that even though maybe CS on the surface doesn't seem connected to all of this, it is all connected. I feel solidarity with the Palestinian people. I feel that they give me the bravery to say this as an educator, and I hope they give you the bravery to go out and take a stand for things like this and do what's right.\n\nAgain, I know this wasn't super appropriate. If you want to report me and get me in trouble for it, like, fine, whatever. One other thing is, I don't feel like I'm super qualified to talk about all this either. (Asks anyone from the audience to share their thoughts afterward.) That's really all I want to say. So again, it's been a good semester. I'll still be around, of course. So, yeah, thanks for coming to all the lectures. I appreciate it. Of course, it is, you know, free Palestine all day, every day, and I want you to remember that your struggle and the Palestinian people's struggle and all of our struggles are interconnected, and I want you to remember to feel that solidarity. So, that's all I have. Thanks for your time, and I'll see you next time.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThe subheadings, paragraph spacing, and punctuations where added by me for ease of reading.\n\nSome expletives that didn't translate well into formal text have been removed.\n\nFiller words like \"um\", \"so\", \"like\", etc... where removed where necessary.\n\nPlease feel free to watch the ground truth video as it's impossible for me to translate the emotional context behind the words into the text format.\n\nMotivation is to make the information available in text format so that people can be better informed about what was said and make their own informed decisions about the situation.\n\nHopefully comments can be civil and respectful.

            "body": "What do the people even mean when they say \"[two state solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution)\"?\n\nWell, if you ask, they will tell you that mean Palestinian state should be created, officially recognized, admitted into the UN, Israel should end its occupation, etc. Which is fine, if you think all of that sounds like a great idea, more power to you. *But why do you call this a \"solution\"?* Why do you think it will end the conflict and not make it worse?\n\nLet's for example look at the ongoing war in Europe between Russia and Ukraine. Why isn't anyone suggesting \"two state solution\" as way out of this conflict? Obviously because it makes no sense: Russia and Ukraine are *already* two separate states, most people agree that's how it should be, yet we still have a war. \n\nOnce you start thinking along these lines, you immediately realize that war between two sovereign, internationally recognized states is entirely common thing. So how is this a \"solution\" of Israeli Palestinian conflict? What do we miss?\n\nIf you ask, people are probably going to tell you \"yes but when we propose Palestinian state, we mean that there will be an agreement signed between two sides which would officially declare the conflict resolved\". Thus, a *solution*. OK.\n\nWell, for one thing, this adds another important constraint to the proposed \"2SS\" framework, because as we know Palestinians have plenty other demands in addition to just territory and statehood. This is not the point of this post though, so let's say for the sake of this discussion such a comprehensive peaceful agreement is indeed signed. Is that it?\n\nGoing back again to the war in Europe, in fact, Ukraine and Russia signed just [an agreement like that back in 1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum). It had all the same components people expect from future Israel/Palestine peace agreement: mutual recognition, security guarantees, borders, settlement of outstanding disputes, everything. So what happened? Why do we have a war?\n\nOf course, there were always people in Russia who never considered Ukraine as a fully legitimate state and Ukrainians as a separate nation. It's just that in 1994 they weren't in power and even if they were, they didn't have enough resources to attack Ukraine, until in 2014 they were and they did. That's all. No agreement could ever prevent this development.\n\nWe all understand that no matter what Palestinian leaders might sign, there will be many, if not majority, of Palestinians who wouldn't be happy with this and will start plotting how to use newly acquired territory and international status to get \"justice\" by destroying Israel and \"returning\" to their homeland Zionists stole from them. \n\n---\n\nNow, if you get up until this point in a discussion with a proponent of \"two state solution\", they will probably tell you something along the lines \"every state has its extremists but normally it doesn't go to war just like that because most people don't want war and state has its own enforcement mechanisms to contain extremists\".\n\n*This is the gist of it*. A \"state\" is usually understood to mean that residents of this state have their own internal life and internal politics which is more important to them than taking a revenge, however justified, against their neighbors. We see this playing out every day. This is why Iran is now reportedly having second thoughts on starting a war with Israel, this is why border between Israel and Syria has been mostly peaceful, this is why China hasn't invaded Taiwan yet, and so on. For a state to attack Israel is a big threshold to cross, because Israel is not exactly defenseless and in all likelihood the life in that hypothetical state will never be the same, to put it mildly.\n\nThat, if you think about it, the only reason why people see \"two state\" as *solution*. Let's give Palestinians something of their own, something they won't want to lose, a life which will be more important to them than \"Nakba\" and all Zionists in the world combined. Then there will be peace.\n\n---\n\nAnd this finally brings us to Gaza post 2005 withdrawal.\n\nBecause while not officially a sovereign state, Gaza had *a lot* of what's described above. For the first time ever, Palestinians had a territory of their own, with its own power struggles, economy, education, politics, etc. I am sure many of the readers think of pre-war Gaza as some kind of hellhole, a place people barely survive in, an \"open air prison\" where everyone only thinks how to get food tomorrow. Well, it wasn't. In [this post](https://new.reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/18rn9yf/pictures_from_prewar_gaza_there_are_also_some/) I collected a few pictures and [videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel_Palestine/comments/18rn9yf/comment/kf25xc1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from Gaza, please take a look; there are many more you can (still) find online. Gaza city was a beautiful place, and Islamic University of Gaza was amazing. \n\nSince the last large-scale conflict in 2014, many neighborhoods were rebuilt (often with Qatari money, which people for some reason now blame Netanyahu for as allegedly \"funding Hamas\"). There was a whole new generation growing up who only ever saw an Israeli on their smartphones. Furthermore, amazingly, Israel and Hamas kind of learned to coexist. After 2014, regular escalations were becoming less and less destructive and bloody. Egyptian mediators learned to quickly resolve the occasional issues. More and more Palestinians were saying they actually wanted Hamas to turn their attention to administering Gaza (or be replaced with someone who would). The theory that independence fosters peace *was working*.\n\nUntil one day it wasn't.\n\n---\n\nI know, *I know*, that many of you are now jumping up to tell me why exactly this happened and what went wrong. It's all Israel's fault! Israel never actually wanted peace and that's why they supported Hamas in Gaza to split Palestinians national movement! The whole withdrawal was just a trick to preempt Palestinian statehood! This is \"illegal blockade\"! Israel still controlled Gaza after withdrawal! Israel killed thousand of Palestinians in these 17 years! Israel was still an occupier in WB! Settlements kept expanding! Israel was controlling every gram of food and water coming into Gaza to make sure Palestinians only have bare minimum to survive! How *dare* you asking why Palestinians fought back? What else could they do? WWYD?\n\nYou will forgive me if I am not going to give here detailed response to each one of these claims. Almost of them are either plain wrong (for example, Gaza produced almost all water it needed, Israel only supplied a very small amount), blame Israel for entirely normal behaviour for a sovereign nation (such as playing politics or import/export restrictions) or swap cause and effect (pretending that blockade was not a result of aggression from Gaza but a reason for it). That's not really the point.\n\nWhen people propose \"two state solution\", it's entirely unrealistic to expect that both nations will have warm and harmonious relations from day one. The opposite is true. Relations will be extremely tense for a long time. If some steps Israel might take to protect its security, even if you disagree with them, could ruin the peace just like that, how do we expect this to work? Is the plan here to simply see the peace crumble, immediately blame Israel and walk away?\n\nThe only justification behind \"two state solution\" which makes sense is not that Palestinians are suddenly going to love Israel once they get their own state, but that while hating Israel they'll still value welfare of their national state and their personal lives more than any military retaliation against Israel. So why did this fail in Gaza?\n\nIt's nice to tell yourself \"I love both nations, I want peace, I am pro-two state solution\", no questions about it, but if you want to be honest with yourself, you have to ask yourself \"if two state solution solution is so great, what went wrong in Gaza?\" and try to find an answer which is not just blaming Israel for everything, *not because it's necessarily wrong, but because it's pointless*; if your understanding of \"two state solution\" is not compatible with Israel as one these two states, it's not worth much.\n\nAfter the massacre of October 7, continue advocating for \"two state solution\" as if nothing happened is intellectually dishonest. Gaza was not a perfect experiment at Palestinian statehood \u2013 far from it \u2013 but nothing which happens in real life is ever going to be perfect. A failure at something doesn't preclude us from trying again and perhaps succeeding in the future, but *only* if we're ready to learn the lessons.",

I spent hours on wikipedia collecting notes and then reduced them into this summary. I know its missing a lot of historical and cultural context, and I attempted to avoid including information that might be considered subjective. It is intentionally simplified in the interest of brevity. -- my notes are more comprehensive but this is a distillation of what I find to be the most salient points required to for a minimal contextual understanding of conflict. \n\n*  \u29bf 1936 \u2013 The Peel Commission proposes to allocate 80% of the disputed territory to Palestine and 20% to Israel; the offer is accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by Arab leaders.\n\n* \u29bf 1947 \u2013 The United Nations proposes to allocate 42% to Palestine, 56% to Israel; Jewish leaders accept, Arab leaders reject. Israel is founded the following year, largely based on the proposal.\n \n* \u29bf 1948 \u2013 Israel successfully defends against an invasion by a coalition of Arab states, expanding its territory beyond what it was allocated by the UN. The war causes displacement of almost 1 million Palestinians, which is considered the beginning of the present day Israeli-Palestinian conflict; as well the beginning of the mass-exodus of Jews from the neighboring Arab states.\n \n* \u29bf 1967 \u2013 Egypt leads a coalition of Arab countries with the goal of exterminating Israel. The \u201cSix Day War\u201d begins when Israel preemptively attacks Egypt in response to a military blockade, and ends with Israel taking coalition territories from three neighboring states.\n \n* \u29bf 2000 - United States hosted the Camp David Summit, where Palestinians rejected a proposal, citing unfair allocation of lands and failing to satisfy their essential requirements. \n* The following decades are characterized by regular attacks by terrorists against Israel, with Israel\u2019s counter-terrorism policies sparking significant domestic and international criticism for its impact on Palestinian civilians and the broader conflict.\n\nI would appreciate any feedback, and especially would love for people to help me fill in any essential gaps in my understanding. Thank you!\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the feedback! I'm legit surprised at how many people had genuinely helpful contributions because I see a lot of uninformed people with really strong opinions supporting one side or the other everywhere on reddit. \n\nAt this point, I have a hard time explaining the historical, cultural, and religious motivations of the Arab side pre-1948 concisely. It seems really odd that they would just have it out for the Jews with no desire at all to coexist.",

Mainly, the claim that Gaza is an \"open air prison\", and that Israel is at fault for Hamas' actions by making Gaza poor. This is false, and I'm here to tackle it. In fact, Hamas are themselves are the reason why Gaza is poor and suffering. \n\n[Palestinians have been at the receiving end of the largest foreign aid program per capita in history, bigger than the Marshal Plan](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/palestinians-lost-marshall-plans) yet almost none of it has went to Gazan and Palestinians civilians in general. In fact, in the last decade Gaza's poverty rate had almost doubled, despite the amount of foreign aid only rising.\u00a0\n\nHamas has [500km of tunnels under Gaza](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67097124), a number confirmed both by themselves and by the IDF.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFor some perspective, the London Underground is 400km, and the NYC subway is 399km.\u00a0\n\nThe IDF said that 18 cross-border tunnels they destroyed in the 2014 war took [800,000 tons of concrete to construct, and some 30-90 million USD.](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/israel-middle-east/articles/concrete-facts-about-hamas). That's enough concrete to construct 7 Burj Khalifas.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn the same war, Egypt claims to have destroyed 1340 tunnels. Even if each tunnel only took 10% the material and cost the tunnels into Israel, and even if we go by the low estimate(30$ million), that amounts to 54 Burj Khalifas and 223,333,333$. Or roughly 5.5 cents out of every single dollar of **humanitarian aid** sent to the Palestinians **since 1993.**\u00a0 And that's a very generous estimate, if we use the high estimate it goes up to 16.75% of all the aid. And again, that's still if you only take 10%.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFurthermore, those are just the tunnels we knew of, **in 2014**. Not only were there thousands more that remained uncovered, Hamas claims to have doubled the extent of their tunnels since then. And that's without even going into all the weapons they use the very same humanitarian money to buy. And it's incredibly worth noting that all this material and money was let into Gaza **with the Israeli consent.**\n\nAnd about those Tunnels, just in case you don't understand how long 500km is, that's enough to host 1,335,113 people standing shoulder to shoulder, or roughly 56% of Gaza's population all at once. It's undoubtedly big enough to let Gazan civilians to take shelter there during Israeli bombardment. And when questioned about it, [Hamas said](https://youtu.be/vdmtfRj6KX0?si=jLhjV1_sJYH2Dsb5) that the tunnels are only for fighters, and that it isn't their responsibly **as Gaza's ruling government** to care for their own civilians, throwing responsibility to the UN.\u00a0\n\nAnd Gazans know all of this. Which is why when [Arab Barometer](https://www.arabbarometer.org/media-news/what-palestinians-really-think-of-hamas/) polled Gazan civilians on **the day before the war**, they were almost twice as likely to blame Hamas (31%) than the Israeli blockade (16%) for their economic situation. 44% said they have no trust at all in the Hamas, and an addional 23% said they have little trust in them. 77% said that the Hamas government was either \"not very responsive\" or \"not responsive at all\" to the needs of everyday civilians. And when asked how one can influence Hamas, the plurality said that \"nothing is effective\", with the next biggest answer being \"through personal connections\", aka using its corruption.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd for one final note of corruption, 61% of Gaza's population is considered bellow the poverty line. Meanwhile Hamas' leaders [live in million dollar mansions in Qatar](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12706715/Hamas-terrorist-billionaires-live-marble-floored-mansions.html), with an estimated networth of 11$ billion between the three of them.  \nThe average Gazan makes $2,500 **a year**, meaning it would take one **4.4 MILLION YEARS** to accumulate the same amount of wealth as their leaders. Hamas don't own any unique assets or companies, because they are banned from doing buisness in most countries in the world (for very obvious reasons) meaning all this money is purely humanitarian aid money they stole for themselves. If they were to distribute all of it equally between all Gazans, each one would get twice their yearly salary in an instant. The latest UN report about Gaza estimates that after this war, it would coat half a billion USD to rebuild Gaza, meaning that Hamas can literally rebuild everyrhing in Gaza brand new and still retain 95.5% of their wealth. \n\nThe poverty of Gaza, lack of access to water & food security, lack of education etc. are all by Hamas' own design. They intentionally want to keep Gaza poor and suffering, because that way they can milk sympathy from people in the west who don't know any better.\n\nAll of that money, money spent on tunnels, weapons and ways to attack Israel is money taken out of the pockets of individual Palestinians. Money, material and resources that are stolen from Palestinians to wage a never-ending genocidal and self destructive war against Israel. If it weren't for Hamas, not only would there not be a blockade in the first place, but billions of dollars that were spent on this endless thirst for blood would've instead been used to actually improve the lives of Palestinians.  \nHamas are at fault for every single Palestinian casualty in Gaza in this war, and every war before it. By constantly perpetrating these futile attacks they knowingly risk the lives of their own civilians. By not allowing civilians to take shelter in their tunnels, they knowingly leave them to die. Even if you believe that Israel intentionally attacks civilians, then you have to realize that Hamas are at fault by blocking access to these tunnels.  \nHamas wants civilians to die. And every person who stands with Palestinians should want to see them removed.",

Many families in poverty were forced to spend a third or more of their income to purchase water from unregulated sources, with the hopes that it is safe. Now, this already dire situation is exponentially worse.\n\nSoon after Israel occupied the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, in June 1967, the Israeli military authorities consolidated complete power over all water resources and water-related infrastructure in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT). 50 years on, Israel continues to control and restrict Palestinian access to water in the OPT to a level which neither meets their needs nor constitutes a fair distribution of shared water resources.\n\nIn November 1967 the Israeli authorities issued Military Order 158, which stated that Palestinians could not construct any new water installation without first obtaining a permit from the Israeli army. Since then, the extraction of water from any new source or the development of any new water infrastructure would require permits from Israel, which are near impossible to obtain. Palestinians living under Israel\u2019s military occupation continue to suffer the devastating consequences of this order until today. They are unable to drill new water wells, install pumps or deepen existing wells, in addition to being denied access to the Jordan River and fresh water springs. Israel even controls the collection of rain water throughout most of the West Bank, and rainwater harvesting cisterns owned by Palestinian communities are often destroyed by the Israeli army. As a result, some 180 Palestinian communities in rural areas in the occupied West Bank have no access to running water, according to OCHA. Even in towns and villages which are connected to the water network, the taps often run dry.\n\nhttps://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2017/11/the-occupation-of-water/\n\nhttps://www.hrw.org/news/2023/11/16/israeli-authorities-cutting-water-leading-public-health-crisis-gaza",

I\u2019m actually in the process of creating a Jewish PAC here because the synagogues just aren\u2019t equipped to handle the kind of antisemitism we\u2019ve been dealing with from both government and the University of Vermont. \n\nThe story is a group of people here collected enough signatures to force the city council to consider putting a measure on our March ballot (which also includes the mayor\u2019s race, city council, and the prez primary). The last line of the measure would say: \n\n\u201cWE PLEDGE to join others in working to end all support to Israel\u2019s apartheid regime, settler colonialism, and military occupation.\u201d\n\nAs I organize the community on this I\u2019d welcome your thoughts and experience and leads on what has worked - if anything- in your world to beat back BDS initiatives. \n\nWe had this happen in 2021, too, and had a ceasefire reso come up just last month so tough time for the Jewish community here. Thanks! \n\nAlso obvi we\u2019ll be doing an email and public comment campaign. I\u2019m looking for what arguments and other tactics have worked. Thanks! \ud83d\udc99\n\nUpdate: Thanks everyone who has posted great ideas and support. If you want to stay up to date on the issue free free to DM me and I'll tell you how.",

It goes against the very ethos of an open-market system that the Western world has strived for. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - The BDS has never worked and is never going to.

But if there isn\u2019t any, this seems like a very disrespectful thing to say by Monte. Accusing multiple teams and players of sharing scrim data and plotting to take G2 down with no evidence other than what could have just simply been a smart call by Labrov?\n\nThis seems, more than anything, like an attempt to take credit away from BDS and even accuse them of unsportsmanlike conduct in regards to scrim data. Trying to have a discussion about it is one thing, but saying \u201cit\u2019s clear as day\u201d and blatantly accusing them of such actions is highly unprofessional. Maybe he hasn\u2019t watched Dom\u2019s recent video about the Faker drama yet\u2026\n",

On the other hand, the article points to my anger problems. \n\nYes, I have anger problems and this was the point I needed to work on most on my side for this year. I don't agree with the way the article turned out, inevitably making me look like someone I'm not. \n\nIt's also very important for me to apologize, to BDS and to you who tirelessly support us match after match, day after day.\n\nI'd also like to apologize to my teammates and to Jenax, who today gave their all to make up for my absence from the team and who made me very, very proud despite the fact that I was watching from home, sad and disappointed not to be able to be there.\n\n And finally, I'd like to apologize to the BDS staff and in particular to my Head Coach Striker, who will always be a person I greatly appreciate, and whom I hope this story hasn't fundamentally changed anything between me and him. \n\nI'm a great competitor, and my anger issues are a result of that. \n\nNevertheless, I try to be a better human being every day, and that's why BDS has chosen to continue with me this year, because the monster described in this article is simply not me. \n\nThank you all for reading and understanding.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Ricadam_lol/status/1758993786888126833",

He then proceeds to immediately cleanse and ult away when silenced by Adam, showing Ruler's insane reaction speed.\n\nOf course it is Ruler's first year in the LPL so this is very normal, but it is interesting JDG can be so coordinated in teamfights despite a bit of language barrier.",

The watching experience is so much more fun when it feels like the casters are having fun themselves, and playing into the rivalry is a big part of that. \n\nOnly bringing it up because Drakos on Euphoria sounded hesitant about NA fans possibly taking it the wrong way if he went that route, but as an NA fan I hope Drakos, MarkZ, or whoever else is casting let loose and can have as much fun casting it as we'll have watching it!",

            "body": "Many US states have banned state level contracts for companies that engage in BDS behavior, if twitch is really banning all Israeli IPs, this could cost amazon hundreds of millions of dollars in business from US states.\n\nAmazon could get sanctioned from doing business with 37 states at the moment.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-BDS\\_laws#/media/File:Antibds\\_laws.png](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-BDS_laws#/media/File:Antibds_laws.png)\n\nThis could truly end up being massive. Firstly, tons of tech companies do business through the AWS marketplace. Tech company A will do a contract with city government B and then transact that business through the AWS marketplace. AWS being found to no longer being a valid vendor could void existing contracts or force companies to find new distribution channels for future contracts.  How this move was made without running it by a lawyer who would have told them \"absolutely not\" is insane.\n\nSecondly, some BDS states (lets use Florida as an example), also prohibit state pension funds from investing in a company who engaged in BDS. We're talking about potentially billions of dollars of forced sales of Amazon stock if a state like Florida finds Amazon in violation of the anti-bds statute.\n\nJust to be clear anti-BDS laws would not \"ban\" Amazon in any of the states, your amazon prime orders won't stop if you live in Florida. It would just mean state government entities can no longer contract business to amazon or any of it's subsidiaries and in some states prevent state pension funds from investing in Amazon.\n\nI'm no expert on this matter. If you'd like to know more, I'd suggest you contact your local state representative and ask them if this behavior would violate your state's BDS law. I'll personally be contacting my governor's office on Monday to ask them if this might violate the anti-BDS law of my state.\n\nUpdate/Edit: Messaged Dan on twitter and he said he is looking into this.

            "body": "Just think about it. We have been spoiled before.\n\nIt's 2019. There are 3 competitive regions on the world stage, wild cards and NA. The community is split on who to call the favorites. G2 won MSI, Fnatic had two 5 game series against them, Invictus Gaming are the reigning champions, FPX beat them to win LPL, T1 looks scary when they won LCK while the raw potential of DWG and Griffin makes them a contender.\n\nNobody should've had any doubts who would win after the worlds song was realeased however. \"Fly, fly, Phoenix fly!\" FPX - Funplus Phoenix - was revealed as the champions by Riot before the tournament even began. \"It's time for a new empire.\" China were to become the new overlords as demanded by sun emperor tencent.\n\nWhy does it matter? Riot released the worlds song \"Gods\". Some of you will say \"Well, actually that would just mean Team Whales vs T1 in the finals so Artemis can face off against Zeus, duh.\" And it would be an obvious conclusion. But Team Whales are out. It's not happening.\n\nWe were given the key by the casters over and over again to decypher the message. They keep talking about Adam's champion pool, especially his Garen, Olaf, Darius and Sett. GODS.\n\nBut there is more. While the song is called \"Gods\", there is a line that reveals the whole truth. \"Once you play god, once play god, they gonna crumble one by one.\" The S is missing. Garen, Olaf, Darius and Sett have a 100% win rate currently when played by Adam. Sett however, will turn out to be a false prophet that Adam has to forsake to bring victory to his team. \n\nThe plot armor is too strong, the home crowd loves it and you can make a great skin line out of it. There is no way BDS loses, GOD will lead them to victory. \n\nNow excuse me, this paint isn't going to huff itself.",

This lapse does not define the player and the person he is. If the club and I have chosen to continue with him during the offseason, it is precisely because he brings something to the group, beyond the in-game aspect, and we were satisfied with the relationship he maintains with his teammates and coaches.\n\nEvery player, every coach, every person has areas for improvement. And Adam has made significant efforts over the year to focus on his own. Whether in the game or outside of it. He is a player and a person I appreciate, and the necessityfor a reaction to a particular event does not question that in any way.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to handle the circulating information with great caution: some elements are exaggerated, others simply false.\n\nA team's life is full of ups and downs, each season comes with its share of internal problems in every team. Regardless of its position in the league. In most cases, you won't hear about them, and it would have been preferable for that to be the case here.\"",

            "body": "A quick glance at GG vs BDS, before the first game of Worlds 2023(Not quite, but close enough). Translated from [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubuoAWPI8Iw&t=12151s) where Cloudtemplar, Pony(LCK caster), and Lindarang talk about various Worlds teams, and Worlds in general. This is just from the segment about GG vs BDS, which starts on 10/9 Monday 1pm KST - or about 8 hours after this is posted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CT:** So, there's not much time left until GG vs BDS. I've been looking at various community predictions, and most (Korean)people seem to think that GG is favored. You'll be casting the game live, so I assume you've looked into the teams - Pony, who do you think is going to win?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lindarang:** With the pride of the LCS and LEC on the line.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CT**: Sure, and there's a huge difference between having 3 and 4 teams. Why do you think animals lay tons of eggs? Even if most of them die, you only need a few to live. The more eggs, the better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pony:** So, I get why people think that GG is going to win.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CT**: And why is that?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pony:** To begin with, GG was at MSI. They were a bit shaky during LCS playoffs, which is why they're the 4th seed, but the team itself is strong. They have experience *and* potential, just like the LPL and LCK teams. So people think that they're stronger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CT**: GG also has MSI monster Licorice - Adam will be powerless against him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pony**: But personally? I think BDS is favored. I don't want to get into the nitty gritty of everything, so I'll just talk about the scenario where BDS wins. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lindarang**: Woooah.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CT**: Pony really likes Adam, doesn't he?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pony**: So, the scenario. When Adam has an advantage in lane, he loves to go and pressure the enemy jungle. He's not like other Top laners that place a ward or something - he goes and lives there. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CT**: But that's because he doesn't take TP. He has to do at least that much, doesn't he?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pony**: It's true that he sometimes trips over his own feet trying to exert pressure - when Adam has bad games, it's due to him missing out on farm from vacating top lane for too long. On the flip side, once Adam gets going, he effectively nullifies both the enemy top laner and jungle. And Adam is probably going to make it work out. Why? Because Adam's GODS(Garen, Olaf, Darius, Sett) are hard to practice against. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CT**: GODS may common in solo queue, but that's not quite the same thing, is it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pony:** Yup. Lindarang, how often have you played against GODS(Garen, Olaf, Darius, Sett) during your time as a pro player?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lindarang**: Let me think... I've seen a few Setts, depending on meta, but I don't think I played a single game against a Garen Top. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CT**: Pros, especially LCK pros, rarely deviate from TP tops. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lindarang**: Maybe a few Ignite Rumbles?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CT**: Or Quinn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pony**: So Licorice will have a hard time getting quality practice against GODS, and I expect Adam to lead in lane. And the reason that Adam can play this style is because of the core of the team - Crownie. Crownie is the one that balances out BDS with his massive potential. On GG, Stixxay isn't really known for his strong laning. He's more of a smart veteran player. So, after Crownie and Adam's top- bot double combo attack, BDS will have a much easier game to play than GG.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lindarang**: So you're basically assuming that Adam's shenanigans will work out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pony**: Yes, I am.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CT**: Be it his champion pool or his playstyle, Adam is never happy with going even in lane. It always goes one way the other. He plays a lot of lane-jerking champs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pony**: Lane-jerking champs? Don't you have any... better expressions?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CT**: It's a bit crude, but it gets the point across. He jerks off to his laning prowess. What, jerking off is normal. If you think about it, there's nothing wrong with the expression.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pony:** I... see.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CT**: Pony, do you jerk off?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pony**: There has to be something less vulgar - how about lane... masturbation?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CT**: Okay, do you masturbate then?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pony**: ...\n\n**Pony**: Yes, often. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CT**: Great. Let's call it consolation then. Adam plays a lot of lane-consolation champions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lindarang**: He consoles himself in lane. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pony**: Anyways, Adam tries to influence the map through his unique picks and playstyle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CT**: But these champs tend to have their hands forced. To put in simply, GODS have to go all in at some point. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lindarang**: The funny thing is that Adam doesn't all in very often - he roams a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CT:** Even in solo queue, top laners know that they're fine as long as they don't die to champions like GODS. Just don't die. And since it's so hard to solo kill the opponent, the GODS player has nothing to do but leave the lane. An endless cycle of push, roam, push, roam. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lindarang**: Adam *really* likes roaming mid. Even if he gives up a wave or two. More variance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pony**: Which can sometimes backfire hard. I remember this playoffs game, Adam was playing roamed mid as Malphite and completely flopped. I'm still not sure what his thought process was.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lindarang**: I remember seeing one of his Darius games, he roamed mid and the enemy mid laner just backed off. He sat in the bush for a full minute or something, giving up like 12 minions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CT**: In a way, even though Adam plays lane-consolation champs, he plays for the team instead of for himself. Which sounds weird. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pony**: He plays for everyone's comfort, not just his own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CT**: And top laners usually hate giving up farm too. You'd think that a GODS player would be a manly selfish die-hard, but GODS paradoxically end up being completely selfless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lindarang**: And this strategy is frequently countered. At least, that's how it usually plays out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pony**: He could be thinking about it in another way - I can win the 1 vs 1 even if I'm behind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lindarang**: Or he could just try to console himself harder in lane, and win through that. A change in playstyle. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pony**: Anyways, once BDS's strategy works out, GG will have a really hard time. And Licorice, veteran that he is, might have a hard time against Adam's raw power. What about you two? Who do you think will win?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lindarang**: GG.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pony**: And CT?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CT**: Can I be brutally honest here?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pony**: Are you about to say that you don't care who wins?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CT**: No, I care. What I want to say is similar, but not quite the same. From our perspective, if I was an Asian team, I would want the team with less variance to qualify for Worlds. Since BDS has higher highs and lower lows, I'm more afraid of BDS. GG isn't as scary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lindarang**: The Asian teams probably don't care who wins. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CT:** The top laners might, since the matchup is interesting. Watching Adam play is fun. And disregarding everything else, it's the first Bo5 between two major region teams. We start off Worlds with a Bo5. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pony**: We get a taste of the meta too. A showcase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CT:** Honestly though, the two teams are pretty close in power. It'll be bloody, and I'd be really surprised if one team pulled off a clean 3-0.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lindarang**: Agreed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL notes**\n\n Hi! I'm Yoon. I translate things. I wanted to get out a quick translation before Worlds starts. The GODS(Garen, Olaf, Darius, Sett) acronym is not from the original video, but rather from the Korean community. In the video, Cloudtemplar, Pony, and Lindarang did much more in-depth analysis of the 8 KR/CN teams and G2, which they considered to be the teams that had a real shot at winning Worlds, and TL. They intended to do all of the teams, but they ran out of time after talking for 5 hours. If there's any team that you guys are particularly interested in, let me know, and I'll try to make a translation. ",

But it doesn't actually help Palestine or do anything to vote for a third party. \n\nI feel this way because I have yet to hear anyone explain why they are voting FOR a third party and not just \"I don't want to vote for Harris\" or \"it's a protest vote\" and nothing further. I've never heard anyone explain how it will actually HELP anyone.\n\nTo be clear I don't think voting for Harris will really help Palestine either. She has made her stance clear. She is very pro-Israel. And I don't think that is going to change any time soon. \n\nI think what activists should focus on instead is BDS, getting universities to divest, and mutual aid to those living under siege in Gaza. Along with making sure Palestinian stories are not forgotten. Bearing witness to what is happening. Humanizing Palestinians.\n\nVoting third party however, is not going to help. It's not actually doing anything. It's not actually helping anyone. If you want to vote for a third party that's up to you. Tell me your reasoning for it and how you think it will help. I'd honestly love to be proven wrong.\n\nEdit:\n\nYall. This is not a debate on Israel vs Palestine. That is not the point of this post. The point is if voting a third party will actually advance Palestinian rights in any way. Please stick to that.\n\nEdit 2: good lord this post blew up. I'll read more of the comments later\n\nEdit 3: can mods lock this post it's going off the rails as people are debating Israel vs Palestine instead of the actual point \n\nEdit 4:\n\nI've responded to a lot of comments. I'm done now cuz I actually have better things to do lol. I can't fucking wait for this election to be over",

            "body": "A **new female tournament in Europe**, Storm Takeover, starts tomorrow. Many of Europe's top female teams are playing, such as G2, Vitality, and more!\n\nStorm Takeover covers the France & Benelux regions. Teams must have at least 2 players who are either from France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, or Monaco. Only female or non-binary players who are at least 16 years old are allowed to participate.\n\nHey everyone, I'm Rigas. If you are active here on /r/leagueoflegends, you might know me as the LoL esports journalist specializing in the EU female scene. But this time, I'm not involved just as a journalist. I decided I wanted to compete again, so I put my very own team together for Storm Takeover.\n\n#What is the schedule and format?\n\n5 teams were invited directly to the main event, while 3 more got a spot through the qualifiers. They are split into 2 groups of 4 teams each, with the group format being Best of 1 single round-robin. The top 2 teams per group will proceed to the playoffs, which are double elimination Best of 3/5.\n\nGroup stage games start at 13:00 CEST on both Saturday & Sunday, and at 18:00 CEST on Monday.\n\n[**Group stage full schedule**](https://x.com/_pogtv/status/1797715467676836219) *(Lunar Blossom has been replaced by Team Paradox)*\n\n#Who are the teams?\n\n3 teams are with LEC orgs, 4 teams are with ERL Div 1 orgs, and 1 team is orgless. 6/8 teams are also currently competing in the Equal Esports Cup, the official EMEA league for female teams.\n\n**[G2](https://twitter.com/G2esports) Hel:** G2 Hel are one of just 2 full-time professional teams in the EU female scene, and the best-known team as well. They are perennially considered favorites, and are currently tied at the top of the EEC with a 4-1 record.\n\n**[Team Vitality](https://x.com/TeamVitality) Rising Bees:** The other full-time professional team in the scene, renaming from last year's Team Vitality *French* Bees. They are the ones tied with G2 at the top of the EEC with a 4-1 record.\n\n**[Team BDS](https://x.com/TeamBDS) Valkyries:** The 3rd and last LEC org in this tournament, BDS' female team kept most of its lineup from last year, when they got 3rd place in the EEC; the highest of any team in Storm Takeover. They are currently tied for 7th place in EEC, with a 2-3 record.\n\n**[Solary](https://x.com/SolaryTV) Acad\u00e9mie:** Massively popular French org Solary, whose main team is in the LFL Div 1, are also participating. Last year they were a running a full French-speaking female team, but dropped that requirement for this year. They are currently in 9th place in the EEC, with a 1-4 record.\n\n**[Team GO](https://x.com/Team_GO) Aurora:** Completing the list of the 5 invited teams is Team GO, also a LFL Div 1 org. They are the champions of last year's Coupe des \u00c9toiles, the official French female tournament. Currently in a 4-way tie for 3rd place in the EEC, with a 3-2 record.\n\n**[NORD](https://x.com/NORDEsports) Polaris:** NLC Div 1 org NORD announced its female team in March. While having rough results at first, they've been doing a lot better lately, picking up 2 wins in the Equal Esports Cup last weekend & qualifying to Storm Takeover undefeated. They are currently tied for 7th place in Equal Esports Cup, with a 2-3 record.\n\n**[Team Paradox](https://x.com/teamparadoxgr):** Greek org Team Paradox, whose main team competes in the Greek Legends League, picked up the lineup of smaller org Lunar Blossom Esports. They don't actually have any Greek players, their lineup instead hailing from various European & North African countries.\n\n**[Rigas In Paris](https://x.com/rigasinparis):** Yup, that's my team. I put it together on a budget of \u20ac0, using my knowledge of the female scene's playerbase. Formed just 2 weeks before the qualifier, we defeated established orgs to earn a spot in the main event. So here we are, massive outsiders as an amateur orgless team amongst pro & semi-pro LEC & ERL Div 1 orgs.\n\n#How to watch Storm Takeover?\n\nThe main Storm Takeover stream will be on [the Twitch channel of POG TV](https://www.twitch.tv/pogtv_lol). All games will be shown there, with the commentary language being French.

I get it, G2s curse must feel real af for the fans, but I feel like as American fans we should be hospitable to the team that traveled all the way out here to compete at the highest level. At least give them some cheers while they accept their trophies after getting boo'd the whole tournament. Idk just my opinion. ",

I am unsure if it is too late for me and I really need some advice. \n\nMy situation is that I am 34 years old (about to turn 35). I have my MA in Education and am getting a second MA in International Relations.  I served for two years in the Peace Corps in Ethiopia (about 7 years ago). I served in AmeriCorps in the US and am now an AmeriCorps Director for an educational program of six years that works with native reservations. I also speak Spanish and am learning French. I have also wrote grants worth millions of dollars and manage grant writing as well. I also have a girlfriend who is with me as well (I only mention this due to the unique natuere of this field) \n\nI am proud of the career that I have made and the work I have done, but I am looking for a change. \n\nWith my work, do I have any real chance of being able to transition into this field? I feel that there are a lot of overlapping skills and pieces here, but I am unsure if it is possible to make that transition. \n\nIf people here could be please give me some advice, I would greatly appreciate it, especially for something that could provide me with the opportunity for short-term deployments potentially at this time in my life. \n\nThank you,  \nFairPhrase",
